</StoryBox>

## Planning Your Project

Before writing ANY code, let's plan! Grab paper and pencil.

### Step 1: Define Your Goal

Write one sentence describing what your project does:

> "My project is a _____________ that helps with _____________ by _____________."

Example:
> "My project is a plant monitoring system that helps with keeping plants healthy by checking moisture and automatically watering them."

### Step 2: List Features (MVP First!)

**MVP** means "Minimum Viable Product" - the simplest version that works.

List features in priority:

**Must Have (MVP):**
- [ ] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2
- [ ] Feature 3

**Nice to Have:**
- [ ] Feature 4
- [ ] Feature 5

**Future Ideas:**
- [ ] Feature 6
- [ ] Feature 7

Start with MVP! You can always add more later.

### Step 3: List Required Components

What do you need?

**Hardware:**
- Raspberry Pi (you have this!)
- Sensors (which ones?)
- Buttons/LEDs (how many?)
- Other electronics?

**Software:**
- Python scripts
- Web interface?
- Database/file storage?
- Scheduled tasks?

### Step 4: Sketch It Out

Draw:
- Physical layout (where do components go?)
- Circuit diagram (how are things wired?)
- User interface (what does the screen/web page look like?)
- Data flow (how does information move through the system?)

### Step 5: Break Down Into Tasks

List specific tasks in order:

1. [ ] Set up hardware
2. [ ] Test each sensor individually
3. [ ] Write basic data collection script
4. [ ] Add data storage
5. [ ] Create web interface
6. [ ] Add automation
7. [ ] Test everything together
8. [ ] Polish and document

<FunFact title="Professional Project Planning">
This is EXACTLY how professionals plan projects! This process is called:

- **Requirements Gathering** - What does it need to do?
- **Design** - How will it work?
- **Implementation Plan** - What steps to build it?

Companies spend weeks or months on this phase before writing any code. You're learning real project management skills!
</FunFact>

## Building Your Project

Now the fun part - building!

### Tips for Success

**1. Start Small, Iterate**
Get ONE thing working, then add the next. Don't try to build everything at once!

```python
# Version 1: Just read sensor
print(sensor.read())

# Version 2: Add timestamp
print(f"{time.now()}: {sensor.read()}")

# Version 3: Save to file
with open("data.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(f"{time.now()}: {sensor.read()}\n")

# And so on...
```

**2. Test Constantly**
Test after every small change. Finding bugs early is WAY easier!

**3. Use Print Statements**
Debug by printing what's happening:

```python
print("Starting sensor read...")
data = sensor.read()
print(f"Got data: {data}")
print("Writing to file...")
```

**4. Save Your Work Often**
Make backups! Copy your code to another location:

```bash
$ cp -r my_project my_project_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

**5. Comment Your Code**
You'll forget what code does! Comment it:

```python
# Check if temperature is too high
if temp > 30:
    # Turn on fan at full speed
    fan.set_speed(100)
```

**6. Don't Panic When Stuck**
Everyone gets stuck! Try:
- Take a break (seriously!)
- Search online for similar problems
- Test individual parts separately
- Ask for help (forums, friends, teachers)

### Project Structure

Organize your files:

```
my_project/
├── main.py              # Main program
├── sensors.py           # Sensor reading code
├── web_server.py        # Web interface

└── requirements.txt     # Python packages needed
```

### Example: Building a Temperature Monitor Dashboard

Let's walk through a complete example:

**Project:** Web dashboard showing temperature with alerts

#### Step 1: Read Temperature

```python
# temp_sensor.py
import subprocess

def get_temperature():
    """Read CPU temperature"""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['vcgencmd', 'measure_temp'],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    temp_str = result.stdout.strip()
    temp = float(temp_str.replace("temp=", "").replace("'C", ""))
    return temp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    temp = get_temperature()
    print(f"Current temperature: {temp}°C")
```

Test it:
<TerminalDemo>
{`$ python3 temp_sensor.py
Current temperature: 45.2°C`}
</TerminalDemo>

#### Step 2: Log Data

```python
# temp_logger.py
import json
import time
from datetime import datetime
from temp_sensor import get_temperature

def log_temperature():
    """Log temperature with timestamp"""
    temp = get_temperature()
    timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()

    # Read existing data
    try:
        with open("data/temps.json", "r") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        data = []

    # Add new reading
    data.append({"time": timestamp, "temp": temp})

    # Keep only last 1000 readings
    data = data[-1000:]

    # Save
    with open("data/temps.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

    print(f"Logged: {temp}°C at {timestamp}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    log_temperature()
```

#### Step 3: Automate Logging

```bash
$ crontab -e

# Log temperature every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/my_project/temp_logger.py
```

#### Step 4: Create Web Dashboard

```python
# web_dashboard.py
from flask import Flask, render_template_string
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

HTML_TEMPLATE = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Temperature Monitor</title>

            color: white;
            padding: 40px;
            text-align: center;
        }
        .temp-display {
            font-size: 72px;
            font-weight: bold;
            margin: 40px 0;
        }
        .warning {

        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>🌡️ Raspberry Pi Temperature Monitor</h1>
    <div class="temp-display">{{ current_temp }}°C</div>

    {% if current_temp > 70 %}
    <div class="warning">
        ⚠️ WARNING: Temperature is HIGH!
    </div>
    {% endif %}

    <h2>Recent Readings</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Time</th>
            <th>Temperature</th>
        </tr>
        {% for reading in recent %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ reading.time }}</td>
            <td>{{ reading.temp }}°C</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>

    <p><small>Updates every 5 minutes</small></p>
</body>
</html>
"""

@app.route('/')
def dashboard():
    # Load data
    try:
        with open("data/temps.json", "r") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        data = []

    current_temp = data[-1]["temp"] if data else 0
    recent = data[-10:]  # Last 10 readings

    return render_template_string(
        HTML_TEMPLATE,
        current_temp=current_temp,
        recent=reversed(recent)
    )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

#### Step 5: Make it Auto-Start

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/temp-dashboard.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Temperature Dashboard
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/my_project
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/my_project/web_dashboard.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable temp-dashboard
$ sudo systemctl start temp-dashboard
```

Done! Now you have a complete temperature monitoring system!
