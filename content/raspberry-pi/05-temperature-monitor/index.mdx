# Temperature Monitor: Reading the Real World!

<StoryBox character="pi_princess">
  Welcome to your most exciting lesson yet, maker! Today we're crossing a huge boundary - we're going to read REAL DATA from the physical world!

  Up until now, we've controlled outputs (LEDs) and read simple inputs (buttons). But now we're reading an actual SENSOR that measures temperature and humidity!

  This is where the Raspberry Pi truly shines - it can monitor weather, track environmental conditions, and gather scientific data. Let's build a real temperature monitoring system!
</StoryBox>

## What You'll Need

### Components for This Lesson

**Option 1: DHT11 Sensor** (Budget-friendly)
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Measures: 0-50°C (32-122°F), 20-80% humidity
- Accuracy: ±2°C, ±5% humidity
- Perfect for beginners!

**Option 2: DHT22 Sensor** (More accurate)
- DHT22 (AM2302) Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Measures: -40-80°C (-40-176°F), 0-100% humidity
- Accuracy: ±0.5°C, ±2% humidity
- Better for serious projects

**Other Components:**
- 3× LEDs (red, yellow, green) from previous lessons
- 3× Resistors (220Ω or 330Ω)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Optional: 10kΩ pull-up resistor (some sensors need it, some don't)

<FunFact>
  DHT stands for "Digital Humidity and Temperature"! These sensors are used in weather stations, thermostats, home automation systems, greenhouses, and even spacecraft! NASA uses similar sensors to monitor conditions on the International Space Station!
</FunFact>

## Understanding Digital Sensors

### Analog vs Digital Sensors

**Analog Sensors**:
- Output varies continuously (like a dimmer switch)
- Raspberry Pi CAN'T read analog directly (no ADC built-in)
- Need additional hardware (ADC chip)

**Digital Sensors** (like DHT11/DHT22):
- Send data as digital signals (ones and zeros)
- Communicate using protocols (like morse code for electronics)
- Perfect for Raspberry Pi!

### How the DHT Sensor Works

Inside the DHT sensor:
1. **Humidity sensor**: Measures moisture in the air
2. **Thermistor**: Measures temperature
3. **Microchip**: Converts readings to digital data
4. **Output**: Sends data through one wire

It's like a tiny weather station in one package!

<StoryBox character="pi_princess">
  The DHT sensor uses a protocol called "1-Wire" (technically it's more complex, but that's the idea). The Pi and sensor have a conversation:

  Pi: "Hey, what's the temperature?"
  Sensor: "01101011" (binary for temperature)
  Pi: "Got it, thanks!"

  This happens in milliseconds! The library we'll use handles all this communication for us.
</StoryBox>

## DHT Sensor Pinout

The DHT sensor has 3-4 pins (depending on the model):

**DHT11/DHT22 (3-pin module with built-in resistor):**
- **VCC / +**: Power (3.3V or 5V)
- **DATA**: Signal pin (connects to GPIO)
- **GND / -**: Ground

**DHT11/DHT22 (4-pin raw sensor):**
- **Pin 1**: VCC (3.3-5V)
- **Pin 2**: DATA
- **Pin 3**: Not connected
- **Pin 4**: GND

If you have the 4-pin version, you need a 10kΩ resistor between VCC and DATA (pull-up resistor).

<FunFact>
  Pull-up resistors help with digital communication! They ensure the signal line stays at a known voltage when not in use. Think of it like having a default answer ready - without it, the line would "float" and give random readings!
</FunFact>

## Building the Circuit

### Pin Assignments

- **DHT Sensor VCC**: Physical Pin 2 (5V) or Pin 1 (3.3V)
- **DHT Sensor DATA**: GPIO 4 (Physical Pin 7)
- **DHT Sensor GND**: Physical Pin 6 (GND)
- **Red LED**: GPIO 22 (Physical Pin 15) - Hot alert
- **Yellow LED**: GPIO 27 (Physical Pin 13) - Normal
- **Green LED**: GPIO 17 (Physical Pin 11) - Cold alert

### Wiring Step-by-Step

**TURN OFF YOUR PI FIRST!**

1. **Mount DHT sensor on breadboard**
   - Make note of which pin is which

2. **Connect DHT power**
   - VCC → 5V (Physical Pin 2)
   - GND → Ground (Physical Pin 6)

3. **Connect DHT data**
   - DATA → GPIO 4 (Physical Pin 7)

4. **Add LEDs** (from previous lessons)
   - Red LED on GPIO 22 (with resistor)
   - Yellow LED on GPIO 27 (with resistor)
   - Green LED on GPIO 17 (with resistor)
   - All LED cathodes to GND

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Check your pin layout
pinout

# Pins we're using:
# Pin 1  - 3.3V Power (alternative)
# Pin 2  - 5V Power (for DHT)
# Pin 6  - GND (for DHT)
# Pin 7  - GPIO 4 (DHT Data)
# Pin 11 - GPIO 17 (Green LED)
# Pin 13 - GPIO 27 (Yellow LED)
# Pin 15 - GPIO 22 (Red LED)`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="pi_princess">
  The DHT sensor can use either 3.3V or 5V power - both work fine! However, the DATA pin should still connect to a GPIO pin (which uses 3.3V logic). Most DHT sensors handle this automatically.

  If you have a 3-pin module (with built-in resistor), you're all set! If you have the raw 4-pin sensor, add a 10kΩ resistor between VCC and DATA pins.
</StoryBox>

## Installing the Library

We need to install the DHT sensor library:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

# Install DHT library (Adafruit library)
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht

# Also need libgpiod library
sudo apt-get install -y libgpiod2

# Test installation
python3 -c "import adafruit_dht; print('DHT library installed!')"
# Output: DHT library installed!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Reading Temperature: Basic Code

Let's read the sensor!

```python
import adafruit_dht
import board
from time import sleep

# Set up the DHT sensor on GPIO 4 (Pin 7)
# Use DHT11 or DHT22 depending on your sensor
sensor = adafruit_dht.DHT11(board.D4)  # For DHT11
# sensor = adafruit_dht.DHT22(board.D4)  # For DHT22

print("Temperature Monitor Started!")
print("Reading sensor...")

try:
    while True:
        try:
            # Read temperature and humidity
            temperature_c = sensor.temperature
            humidity = sensor.humidity

            # Convert to Fahrenheit
            temperature_f = temperature_c * (9 / 5) + 32

            # Display readings
            print(f"Temperature: {temperature_c:.1f}°C / {temperature_f:.1f}°F")
            print(f"Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%")
            print("-" * 40)

        except RuntimeError as err:
            # DHT sensors sometimes fail to read
            print(f"Reading error: {err}")

        # Wait 2 seconds between readings
        # (DHT sensors need time between reads)
        sleep(2)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nMonitor stopped")
    sensor.exit()
```

Run this and watch real temperature data appear!

<FunFact>
  The DHT sensor can only be read every 2 seconds! If you try to read it faster, you'll get errors. This is because it needs time to measure and prepare the data. It's like asking someone a question - they need a moment to think before answering!
</FunFact>

## Adding LED Temperature Alerts

Let's make LEDs show temperature ranges:

```python
import adafruit_dht
import board
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep

# Set up sensor
sensor = adafruit_dht.DHT11(board.D4)

# Set up LEDs
red_led = LED(22)      # Hot alert
yellow_led = LED(27)   # Normal
green_led = LED(17)    # Cold alert

def all_leds_off():
    """Turn all LEDs off"""
    red_led.off()
    yellow_led.off()
    green_led.off()

def show_temperature_status(temp_c):
    """Show LED based on temperature"""
    all_leds_off()

    if temp_c < 20:
        # Cold - under 20°C (68°F)
        green_led.on()
        print("❄️  Status: COLD")
    elif temp_c > 25:
        # Hot - over 25°C (77°F)
        red_led.on()
        print("🔥 Status: HOT")
    else:
        # Normal - 20-25°C (68-77°F)
        yellow_led.on()
        print("😊 Status: COMFORTABLE")

print("🌡️  Temperature Monitor with LED Alerts")
print("=" * 50)

try:
    while True:
        try:
            temperature_c = sensor.temperature
            humidity = sensor.humidity
            temperature_f = temperature_c * (9 / 5) + 32

            print(f"\n🌡️  Temperature: {temperature_c:.1f}°C / {temperature_f:.1f}°F")
            print(f"💧 Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%")

            # Show LED status
            show_temperature_status(temperature_c)

            print("-" * 50)

        except RuntimeError as err:
            print(f"Sensor error: {err}")

        sleep(3)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n\n👋 Temperature monitor stopped")
    all_leds_off()
    sensor.exit()
```

Now your LEDs show if it's hot, cold, or just right!

<StoryBox character="pi_princess">
  You've just built a real environmental monitoring system! This is the exact same principle used in:
  - Home thermostats
  - Server room monitors
  - Greenhouse automation
  - Weather stations
  - Smart home systems

  Companies pay thousands for systems that do exactly what you just built!
</StoryBox>

## Temperature Logger

Let's save temperature readings to a file:

```python
import adafruit_dht
import board
from datetime import datetime
from time import sleep

sensor = adafruit_dht.DHT11(board.D4)

# Create log file
log_file = "/home/pi/temperature_log.txt"

print(f"🌡️  Temperature Logger")
print(f"📝 Saving to: {log_file}")
print("=" * 50)

try:
    with open(log_file, "a") as f:
        # Write header
        f.write("\n" + "=" * 50 + "\n")
        f.write(f"Logging started: {datetime.now()}\n")
        f.write("=" * 50 + "\n")

        while True:
            try:
                temperature_c = sensor.temperature
                humidity = sensor.humidity
                timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

                # Create log entry
                log_entry = f"{timestamp} | Temp: {temperature_c:.1f}°C | Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%"

                # Write to file
                f.write(log_entry + "\n")
                f.flush()  # Make sure it's written immediately

                # Also print to screen
                print(log_entry)

            except RuntimeError as err:
                print(f"Sensor error: {err}")

            sleep(60)  # Log every 60 seconds

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n\n📊 Logging stopped")
    sensor.exit()
```

This creates a permanent record of temperature over time!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# View your temperature log
cat /home/pi/temperature_log.txt

# See the last 10 readings
tail -10 /home/pi/temperature_log.txt

# Count total readings
wc -l /home/pi/temperature_log.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

```python
import adafruit_dht
import board
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime

sensor = adafruit_dht.DHT11(board.D4)

# LEDs for visual feedback
status_led = LED(27)

# Statistics tracking
readings = []
max_temp = float('-inf')
min_temp = float('inf')
start_time = datetime.now()

def update_statistics(temp):
    """Update temperature statistics"""
    global max_temp, min_temp

    readings.append(temp)

    # Keep only last 20 readings
    if len(readings) > 20:
        readings.pop(0)

    # Update max/min
    if temp > max_temp:
        max_temp = temp
    if temp < min_temp:
        min_temp = temp

def display_dashboard(temp, humidity):
    """Display comprehensive dashboard"""
    # Clear screen (for cleaner output)
    print("\n" * 2)
    print("=" * 60)
    print("🌡️  TEMPERATURE MONITORING DASHBOARD".center(60))
    print("=" * 60)

    # Current readings
    print(f"\n📊 CURRENT CONDITIONS:")
    print(f"   Temperature: {temp:.1f}°C / {temp * 9/5 + 32:.1f}°F")
    print(f"   Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%")

    # Statistics
    if len(readings) > 0:
        avg_temp = sum(readings) / len(readings)
        print(f"\n📈 STATISTICS:")
        print(f"   Average: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
        print(f"   Maximum: {max_temp:.1f}°C")
        print(f"   Minimum: {min_temp:.1f}°C")
        print(f"   Range: {max_temp - min_temp:.1f}°C")
        print(f"   Readings: {len(readings)}")

    # Runtime
    runtime = datetime.now() - start_time
    print(f"\n⏱️  UPTIME: {runtime.seconds // 60} minutes")

    print("=" * 60)

print("🚀 Starting Advanced Temperature Monitor...")
print("📊 Dashboard will update every 5 seconds")

try:
    while True:
        try:
            # Blink LED to show reading
            status_led.on()

            temperature_c = sensor.temperature
            humidity = sensor.humidity

            # Update statistics
            update_statistics(temperature_c)

            # Display dashboard
            display_dashboard(temperature_c, humidity)

            status_led.off()

        except RuntimeError as err:
            print(f"⚠️  Sensor error: {err}")

        sleep(5)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n\n👋 Dashboard stopped")
    print(f"📊 Total readings collected: {len(readings)}")
    status_led.off()
    sensor.exit()
```

This creates a professional-looking dashboard!

<FunFact>
  Weather stations collect temperature data exactly like this! The National Weather Service has thousands of stations that log temperature every minute. Over time, this data reveals patterns, trends, and climate changes. Your little project is doing real science!
</FunFact>

## Heat Index Calculator

Let's calculate how hot it FEELS (combining temperature and humidity):

```python
import adafruit_dht
import board
from time import sleep

sensor = adafruit_dht.DHT11(board.D4)

def calculate_heat_index(temp_f, humidity):
    """
    Calculate heat index (how hot it feels)
    Heat index combines temperature and humidity
    """
    # Simplified heat index formula
    hi = 0.5 * (temp_f + 61.0 + ((temp_f - 68.0) * 1.2) + (humidity * 0.094))

    # If it's hot enough, use more complex formula
    if hi > 80:
        hi = (-42.379 +
              2.04901523 * temp_f +
              10.14333127 * humidity -
              0.22475541 * temp_f * humidity -
              6.83783e-3 * temp_f**2 -
              5.481717e-2 * humidity**2 +
              1.22874e-3 * temp_f**2 * humidity +
              8.5282e-4 * temp_f * humidity**2 -
              1.99e-6 * temp_f**2 * humidity**2)

    return hi

def get_heat_index_description(hi):
    """Get description of heat index danger level"""
    if hi < 80:
        return "😊 Safe - No heat danger"
    elif hi < 90:
        return "⚠️  Caution - Fatigue possible with prolonged exposure"
    elif hi < 105:
        return "🔶 Extreme Caution - Heat exhaustion possible"
    elif hi < 130:
        return "🔴 Danger - Heat exhaustion likely, heat stroke possible"
    else:
        return "🚨 Extreme Danger - Heat stroke imminent!"

print("🌡️  Heat Index Monitor")
print("=" * 60)

try:
    while True:
        try:
            temp_c = sensor.temperature
            humidity = sensor.humidity
            temp_f = temp_c * (9 / 5) + 32

            # Calculate heat index
            heat_index = calculate_heat_index(temp_f, humidity)
            description = get_heat_index_description(heat_index)

            print(f"\n🌡️  Temperature: {temp_c:.1f}°C / {temp_f:.1f}°F")
            print(f"💧 Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%")
            print(f"🔥 Heat Index: {heat_index:.1f}°F")
            print(f"   {description}")
            print("-" * 60)

        except RuntimeError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        sleep(3)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n👋 Heat index monitor stopped")
    sensor.exit()
```

Now you know how hot it REALLY feels!

<StoryBox character="pi_princess">
  The heat index is super important! At 100°F with 60% humidity, it can FEEL like 120°F! This is why humid days feel so much worse than dry heat. Your body cools itself by sweating, but when humidity is high, sweat can't evaporate - so you can't cool down!

  Weather services use heat index to issue heat warnings. You're calculating the same thing they do!
</StoryBox>

## Data Visualization

Create a simple text-based temperature graph:

```python
import adafruit_dht
import board
from time import sleep

sensor = adafruit_dht.DHT11(board.D4)

# Store last 10 readings
temperature_history = []

def draw_temperature_bar(temp, min_temp=15, max_temp=35):
    """Draw a simple bar graph of temperature"""
    # Calculate bar length (0-50 characters)
    bar_length = int((temp - min_temp) / (max_temp - min_temp) * 50)
    bar_length = max(0, min(50, bar_length))  # Clamp between 0-50

    bar = "█" * bar_length
    print(f"{temp:5.1f}°C | {bar}")

print("🌡️  Temperature Graph")
print("=" * 60)

try:
    while True:
        try:
            temp = sensor.temperature

            # Add to history
            temperature_history.append(temp)
            if len(temperature_history) > 10:
                temperature_history.pop(0)

            # Clear and redraw
            print("\n" * 3)
            print("📊 Last 10 Temperature Readings:")
            print("-" * 60)

            for t in temperature_history:
                draw_temperature_bar(t)

            print("-" * 60)

        except RuntimeError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        sleep(5)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n👋 Graph stopped")
    sensor.exit()
```

Watch temperature trends in real-time!

## Troubleshooting

### "RuntimeError: Timed out waiting for sensor"

This is the most common DHT error! Solutions:
- Check wiring (especially DATA pin to GPIO 4)
- Verify power connections (VCC and GND)
- Add a 10kΩ pull-up resistor if using raw sensor
- Try a different GPIO pin
- Wait longer between readings (3-5 seconds)
- The sensor might be faulty - try a different one

### "RuntimeError: Checksum did not validate"

Data transmission error:
- Use shorter wires (long wires cause interference)
- Keep wires away from motors or other noisy electronics
- Add pull-up resistor if not present
- Try again - occasional errors are normal

### Readings Seem Wrong

- DHT11 is less accurate than DHT22 (±2°C is normal)
- Let sensor warm up for 1-2 minutes
- Sensor might be affected by Pi's heat - move it away
- Compare with another thermometer to verify

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'adafruit_dht'"

Library not installed:
```bash
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht
sudo apt-get install libgpiod2
```

<StoryBox character="pi_princess">
  DHT sensors can be finicky! Don't get discouraged if you get occasional errors - even professional systems deal with sensor glitches. The key is proper error handling (try/except blocks) and patience!

  In real systems, engineers use multiple sensors and average the readings, or throw out obvious errors. This makes the system more reliable!
