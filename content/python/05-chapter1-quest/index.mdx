# Quest: Calculator Creation

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  This is it, champion! Your first REAL programming quest!

  The Code Kingdom needs a powerful calculator to help solve important mathematical problems. Only a skilled Python programmer can build it!

  You'll use EVERYTHING you've learned:
  - Variables to store numbers
  - Math operators to perform calculations
  - Print to display results

  Complete this quest and you'll earn the **Python Pioneer** badge! Let's build something amazing!
</StoryBox>

## Your Mission

Build a calculator program that performs multiple calculations and displays the results in a friendly way!

### Quest Objectives:

1. Create a basic calculator
2. Perform all major math operations
3. Calculate real-world problems
4. Display results professionally

## Part 1: The Basic Calculator

Let's start by creating a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide!

<Challenge
  id="quest1-basic-calc"
  title="Basic Calculator"
  description="Create variables and perform basic calculations"
  steps={[
    {
      command: 'num1 = 10',
      hint: "Create first number variable"
    },
    {
      command: 'num2 = 5',
      hint: "Create second number variable"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Addition:", num1 + num2)',
      hint: "Add the numbers and display result"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Subtraction:", num1 - num2)',
      hint: "Subtract and display"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Multiplication:", num1 * num2)',
      hint: "Multiply and display"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Division:", num1 / num2)',
      hint: "Divide and display"
    }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

### Your Calculator Should Show:

<TerminalDemo>
{`Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Part 2: Advanced Operations

Now let's add the special operators you learned!

<Challenge
  id="quest1-advanced-calc"
  title="Advanced Calculator"
  description="Add power, modulo, and floor division"
  steps={[
    {
      command: 'num1 = 10',
      hint: "Same numbers as before"
    },
    {
      command: 'num2 = 3',
      hint: "Change to 3 for interesting results"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Power:", num1 ** num2)',
      hint: "Calculate 10 to the power of 3"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Modulo:", num1 % num2)',
      hint: "Find the remainder"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Floor Division:", num1 // num2)',
      hint: "Divide without decimals"
    }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Looking good! Now let's make it more professional with a nice display format!
</StoryBox>

## Part 3: Professional Calculator Display

Create a calculator with a nice, formatted output!

```python
# Calculator Title
print("=" * 30)
print("   PYTHON CALCULATOR 3000")
print("=" * 30)
print()

# Get our numbers
number1 = 15
number2 = 4

# Perform calculations
addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2
division = number1 / number2
power = number1 ** number2
modulo = number1 % number2
floor_div = number1 // number2

# Display results
print("Numbers:", number1, "and", number2)
print()
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)
print("Power:", power)
print("Modulo (remainder):", modulo)
print("Floor Division:", floor_div)
print()
print("=" * 30)
print("   CALCULATIONS COMPLETE!")
print("=" * 30)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`==============================

## Bonus Challenge: Build Your Own!

Now it's time to get creative! Build a calculator that solves a problem YOU care about!

Ideas:
- **Temperature Converter** - Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- **Distance Calculator** - Convert miles to kilometers
- **Time Calculator** - Calculate hours from minutes
- **Money Converter** - Calculate change or tips
- **Age Calculator** - Calculate age in days or hours

Example Temperature Converter:
```python
print("=== TEMPERATURE CONVERTER ===")
celsius = 25
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
print(celsius, "°C =", fahrenheit, "°F")
```

  Take a break, celebrate your victory, and I'll see you in the next chapter!
</StoryBox>

## Keep Practicing!

The best way to master programming is to PRACTICE! Try these:

1. Modify your calculator to use different numbers
2. Add more real-world calculation problems
3. Create calculators for things you care about
4. Experiment with different operators
5. Show your calculator to friends and family!

Remember: Every expert programmer started exactly where you are now. The difference is they kept going!
