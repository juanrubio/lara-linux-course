# Hello, World!

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  This is it! The moment every programmer remembers forever - writing your FIRST program!

  For over 40 years, programmers have started their journey with a "Hello, World!" program. It's like a tradition - a rite of passage!

  Today, YOU become a programmer. Let's make some magic happen!
</StoryBox>

## The Most Famous Program Ever

There's a tradition in programming: your first program should print the words "Hello, World!" to the screen.

Why? Because it proves:
- Your computer can run the language
- You can write and execute code
- You're officially a programmer!

Let's do it! Here's your first Python program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

That's it! Just one line! When you run this, you'll see:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ python3 hello.py
Hello, World!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  The first "Hello, World!" program was written by Brian Kernighan in 1972 for the C programming language. Now it's how EVERY programmer starts!
</FunFact>

## Understanding print()

The `print()` function is your way to talk to the user! It displays text on the screen.

Let's break down the parts:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
#  │      │
#  │      └─ The message (in quotes)
#  └──────── The function name
```

**Important parts:**
- `print` - The function that displays text
- `()` - Parentheses that hold what you want to print
- `""` - Quotes around your text (called a "string")

## Try Different Messages!

You can print ANYTHING you want! Try these:

```python
print("I am learning Python!")
print("My name is [YOUR NAME]")
print("Python is awesome!")
print("I can make the computer talk!")
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ python3 messages.py
I am learning Python!
My name is [YOUR NAME]
Python is awesome!
I can make the computer talk!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Printing Multiple Things

Want to print more than one thing on a line? Just separate them with commas:

```python
print("Hello", "there", "friend!")
```

Output:
<TerminalDemo>
{`Hello there friend!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Python automatically adds spaces between items!

## Print Numbers Too!

You don't need quotes for numbers:

```python
print(42)
print(100)
print(2024)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`42
100
2024`}
</TerminalDemo>

You can mix text and numbers:

```python
print("I am", 12, "years old")
print("My favorite number is", 7)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`I am 12 years old
My favorite number is 7`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  See how easy Python is? You're already making the computer do what you want! That's the power of programming!

  Notice how print() just KNOWS what to do? That's because it's a "function" - a pre-built tool that Python gives you. We'll learn more about functions later!
</StoryBox>

## Print Blank Lines

Want to add space between your output? Just use print() with nothing inside:

```python
print("First line")
print()
print("Second line with space above!")
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`First line

Second line with space above!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Fun with Special Characters

You can print emojis and special characters too!

```python
print("Hello! 👋")
print("Python 🐍 is fun!")
print("I love coding! ❤️")
print("⭐ ⭐ ⭐")
```

## Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them!)

Everyone makes mistakes when learning! Here are the most common:

### Mistake 1: Forgetting Quotes
```python
# Wrong:
print(Hello)

# Right:
print("Hello")
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Parentheses
```python
# Wrong:
print "Hello"

# Right:
print("Hello")
```

### Mistake 3: Mismatched Quotes
```python
# Wrong:
print("Hello')

# Right:
print("Hello")
# or
print('Hello')
```

<FunFact>
  In Python, you can use "double quotes" or 'single quotes' for text. Both work exactly the same! Just make sure they match on both ends.
</FunFact>

## Your Turn to Create!

    {
      command: 'print("Hello, World!")',
      hint: "The classic first program!"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("My name is [YOUR NAME]")',
      hint: "Introduce yourself to Python!"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("I am", 12, "years old")',
      hint: "Mix text and numbers"
    },

      hint: "Print multiple words"
    }

## Creative Challenge!

Try creating an ASCII art picture using print()! Here's an example:

```python
print("  /\\_/\\  ")
print(" ( o.o ) ")
print("  > ^ <  ")
print("  /   \\  ")
```

This makes a cute cat! Can you create:
- A smiley face
- Your initials
- A simple house
- Anything you imagine!

## Quiz Time!

- Write and run Python programs
- Use the print() function
- Display text and numbers
- Combine multiple items in one print
- Avoid common beginner mistakes

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  YOU DID IT! You're officially a programmer now! 🎉

  Every expert programmer started exactly where you are now. The difference is they kept going, kept learning, and kept building!

  Next up, we'll learn about VARIABLES - a way to store information and make your programs even more powerful!

## Command Reference

| Code | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `print("text")` | Display text |
| `print(42)` | Display a number |
| `print("Hi", "there")` | Display multiple things |
| `print()` | Print a blank line |
