# While Loops: Loop Until Conditions Change

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Welcome back, coding champion! Today we're learning about the WHILE loop - the for loop's clever cousin!

  Remember how for loops repeat a specific number of times? Well, while loops are different. They keep going AS LONG AS a condition is true!

  It's like saying "Keep playing video games WHILE you have battery left" or "Keep eating cookies WHILE there are cookies in the jar!"
</StoryBox>

## What's a While Loop?

A **while loop** repeats code as long as a condition stays `True`. When the condition becomes `False`, the loop stops!

Think of real-life examples:
- Keep swimming WHILE you're not at the shore
- Keep waiting WHILE the pizza isn't ready
- Keep playing WHILE the timer hasn't hit zero

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Count to 5 using a while loop
counter = 1

while counter <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {counter}")
    counter = counter + 1

print("Blast off!")

# Output:
# Count: 1
# Count: 2
# Count: 3
# Count: 4
# Count: 5
# Blast off!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Let's break it down:
1. Start with `counter = 1`
2. Check: Is `counter <= 5`? Yes! Run the loop
3. Print the counter
4. Add 1 to counter
5. Repeat from step 2 until counter is 6 (not <= 5)

<FunFact>
  While loops are PERFECT for games! "While player is alive, keep playing" or "While enemies remain, keep fighting!" The game doesn't know how long it will last - it depends on the player!
</FunFact>

## For Loop vs While Loop

When should you use each?

| Use For Loop When... | Use While Loop When... |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| You know how many times to loop | You don't know how many times |
| Looping through a list | Waiting for something to happen |
| Counting specific numbers | Repeating until a condition changes |
| "Do this 10 times" | "Do this until user says stop" |

<TerminalDemo>
{`# FOR LOOP: You know exactly how many items
games = ["Minecraft", "Roblox", "Fortnite"]
for game in games:
    print(game)

# WHILE LOOP: You don't know when user will quit
playing = True
score = 0
while playing:
    score = score + 10
    print(f"Score: {score}")
    if score >= 50:
        playing = False
        print("You win!")

# Output:
# Score: 10
# Score: 20
# Score: 30
# Score: 40
# Score: 50
# You win!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## The Danger: Infinite Loops!

Be careful! If your condition never becomes `False`, the loop runs FOREVER!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# DON'T DO THIS! (Infinite loop)
# counter = 1
# while counter <= 5:
#     print(counter)
#     # Oops! Forgot to add 1 to counter!
#     # This will print 1 forever!

# THE FIX: Always change the variable in your condition!
counter = 1
while counter <= 5:
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1  # This makes the loop end eventually!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  If you accidentally create an infinite loop, don't panic! Just press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop it.

  Always make sure your while loop's condition will eventually become False. Otherwise, your program will run forever!
</StoryBox>

## Break: Escape the Loop Early!

Sometimes you want to exit a loop before it naturally ends. Use `break`!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Search for a specific item
items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

for item in items:
    print(f"Checking: {item}")
    if item == "cherry":
        print("Found cherry! Stopping search.")
        break  # Exit the loop immediately!

print("Loop ended")

# Output:
# Checking: apple
# Checking: banana
# Checking: cherry
# Found cherry! Stopping search.
# Loop ended`}
</TerminalDemo>

`break` is useful for:
- Finding something in a list (stop when found!)
- User wants to quit
- Error occurs and you need to stop

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Guess the number game
secret_number = 7
guesses = 0

while True:  # Infinite loop! But we'll use break to exit
    guess = int(input("Guess the number (1-10): "))
    guesses = guesses + 1

    if guess == secret_number:
        print(f"Correct! You guessed it in {guesses} tries!")
        break  # Exit the loop!
    elif guess < secret_number:
        print("Too low! Try again.")
    else:
        print("Too high! Try again.")`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Continue: Skip to Next Loop

`continue` skips the rest of the current loop and jumps to the next one!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Print only odd numbers from 1 to 10
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 0:  # If even
        continue  # Skip the rest and go to next number
    print(num)

# Output:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# 7
# 9`}
</TerminalDemo>

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Process items but skip damaged ones
items = ["sword", "damaged shield", "potion", "damaged helmet", "map"]

for item in items:
    if "damaged" in item:
        print(f"Skipping {item}...")
        continue  # Skip to next item
    print(f"Adding {item} to inventory!")

# Output:
# Adding sword to inventory!
# Skipping damaged shield...
# Adding potion to inventory!
# Skipping damaged helmet...
# Adding map to inventory!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Think of `break` as "EXIT THE BUILDING!" and `continue` as "SKIP TO THE NEXT ROOM!" Both are powerful tools for controlling your loops!
</FunFact>

## Real-World Example: Game Loop

Most games use a while loop for the main game logic!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Simple game loop
health = 100
playing = True
turn = 1

while playing:
    print(f"\n--- Turn {turn} ---")
    print(f"Health: {health}")

    action = input("What do you do? (attack/heal/quit): ").lower()

    if action == "attack":
        damage = 10
        health = health - damage
        print(f"You took {damage} damage!")

        if health <= 0:
            print("Game Over! You were defeated!")
            playing = False
            break

    elif action == "heal":
        heal_amount = 20
        health = health + heal_amount
        print(f"You healed {heal_amount} HP!")

    elif action == "quit":
        print("Thanks for playing!")
        playing = False
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid action!")
        continue  # Skip turn counter

    turn = turn + 1

print(f"Final score: {turn} turns survived!")`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  See how the game keeps running while playing is True? The player can break out by choosing quit or losing all health!

  This is exactly how real games work. One big while loop that keeps running until the game ends!
</StoryBox>

## Common While Loop Patterns

### Pattern 1: Input Validation

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Keep asking until valid input
age = -1
while age < 0 or age > 120:
    age = int(input("Enter your age (0-120): "))
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        print("That's not a valid age!")

print(f"Thanks! Your age is {age}")`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Pattern 2: Countdown

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Countdown from 10
countdown = 10
while countdown > 0:
    print(countdown)
    countdown = countdown - 1
print("Happy New Year!")`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Pattern 3: Process Until Done

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Process tasks until list is empty
tasks = ["homework", "chores", "practice"]

while tasks:  # While list is not empty
    current_task = tasks.pop(0)  # Remove first item
    print(f"Doing: {current_task}")

print("All tasks complete!")`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Loop Control Cheat Sheet

| Statement | What It Does | When to Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `while condition:` | Repeat while True | Don't know how many times to loop |
| `break` | Exit loop immediately | Found what you're looking for, or error occurred |
| `continue` | Skip to next loop | Skip certain items but keep looping |
| `while True:` | Infinite loop | Use with break to control when to exit |

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  You're becoming a loop master! You now know TWO types of loops:

  - FOR loops: When you know how many times
  - WHILE loops: When you loop until something changes

  Plus you've got break and continue in your toolkit for precise control!

  Now let's learn some powerful operations you can do with lists. Time to level up your list skills!
