<StoryBox character="python_pete" mood="excited">
Congratulations, adventurer! You've learned variables, loops, functions, collections, and file handling. Now it's time to put it all together!

Today, we're building a **complete project** from scratch. Not just a few lines of code - a real, working application that does something useful. This is where you become a true Python developer!
</StoryBox>

## What Makes a Good Project?

Before we start coding, let's think about what makes a project "complete":

1. **Clear Purpose** - It solves a real problem or need
2. **Multiple Features** - It does several related things
3. **Data Persistence** - It saves and loads data
4. **User-Friendly** - Easy menus and clear instructions
5. **Error Handling** - Doesn't crash when users make mistakes
6. **Good Organization** - Functions with clear purposes

<FunFact title="Project Structure">
Professional programmers organize projects like this:
```
my_project/
├── main.py          # The main program
├── data/            # Folder for data files
│   └── saves.json
└── README.md        # Instructions for users
```

For now, we'll keep it simple with one file, but this is how real projects look!
</FunFact>

## Project Idea: Task Manager

Let's build a **task manager** (also called a "todo list"). It will let users:
- Add tasks with priority levels
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Save/load tasks from a file
- Delete tasks

This is a perfect first project because it uses EVERYTHING you've learned!

## Step 1: Planning

Before writing code, let's plan our functions:

```python
# Functions we need:
- load_tasks() - Load tasks from JSON file
- save_tasks(tasks) - Save tasks to JSON file
- add_task() - Add a new task
- view_tasks() - Display all tasks
- complete_task() - Mark a task as done
- delete_task() - Remove a task
- show_menu() - Display the menu
- main() - Run the program
```

<StoryBox character="python_pete" mood="proud">
Professional programmers always plan before coding! It's like drawing a map before going on an adventure. You can change the plan as you go, but having one makes everything easier.
</StoryBox>

## Step 2: Building the Project

Let's build it piece by piece!

<TerminalDemo>
```python
import json

# File where we'll save tasks
TASKS_FILE = "tasks.json"

def load_tasks():
    """Load tasks from file, return empty list if file doesn't exist"""
    try:
        with open(TASKS_FILE, "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return []

def save_tasks(tasks):
    """Save tasks to file"""
    with open(TASKS_FILE, "w") as file:
        json.dump(tasks, file, indent=4)
    print("Tasks saved!")

def add_task():
    """Add a new task"""
    tasks = load_tasks()

    print("\n=== ADD NEW TASK ===")
    description = input("Task description: ")

    print("Priority: 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High")
    priority = input("Priority (1-3): ")

    # Validate priority
    if priority not in ["1", "2", "3"]:
        print("Invalid priority! Using Medium.")
        priority = "2"

    # Create task dictionary
    task = {
        "description": description,
        "priority": int(priority),
        "completed": False
    }

    tasks.append(task)
    save_tasks(tasks)
    print(f"✓ Added task: {description}")

def view_tasks():
    """Display all tasks"""
    tasks = load_tasks()

    if not tasks:
        print("\nNo tasks yet! Time to add some.")
        return

    print("\n=== YOUR TASKS ===")

    priority_names = {1: "LOW", 2: "MEDIUM", 3: "HIGH"}

    for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
        status = "✓ DONE" if task["completed"] else "○ TODO"
        priority = priority_names[task["priority"]]

        print(f"{i}. [{status}] {task['description']}")
        print(f"   Priority: {priority}")
        print()

def complete_task():
    """Mark a task as complete"""
    tasks = load_tasks()

    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks to complete!")
        return

    view_tasks()
    choice = input("Enter task number to mark complete: ")

    try:
        index = int(choice) - 1
        if 0 <= index < len(tasks):
            tasks[index]["completed"] = True
            save_tasks(tasks)
            print(f"✓ Completed: {tasks[index]['description']}")
        else:
            print("Invalid task number!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a number!")

def delete_task():
    """Delete a task"""
    tasks = load_tasks()

    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks to delete!")
        return

    view_tasks()
    choice = input("Enter task number to delete: ")

    try:
        index = int(choice) - 1
        if 0 <= index < len(tasks):
            deleted = tasks.pop(index)
            save_tasks(tasks)
            print(f"✗ Deleted: {deleted['description']}")
        else:
            print("Invalid task number!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a number!")

def show_menu():
    """Display the main menu"""
    print("\n" + "="*40)
    print("         TASK MANAGER")
    print("="*40)
    print("1. Add task")
    print("2. View tasks")
    print("3. Complete task")
    print("4. Delete task")
    print("5. Exit")
    print("="*40)

def main():
    """Main program loop"""
    print("Welcome to Task Manager!")

    while True:
        show_menu()
        choice = input("\nChoose an option (1-5): ")

        if choice == "1":
            add_task()
        elif choice == "2":
            view_tasks()
        elif choice == "3":
            complete_task()
        elif choice == "4":
            delete_task()
        elif choice == "5":
            print("\nGoodbye! Stay productive!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice! Please choose 1-5.")

# Start the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

<StoryBox character="python_pete" mood="excited">
Look at what you just created! This is a **real, working application**. It has:
- A menu system
- Data persistence (saves to JSON)
- Error handling
- Multiple features
- Clean organization

You could actually use this every day to manage your tasks!
</StoryBox>

## Understanding Key Parts

Let's break down some important concepts:

### The `if __name__ == "__main__":` Block

<TerminalDemo>
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
</TerminalDemo>

This is a Python idiom that means "only run this code if this file is run directly (not imported)". For now, just know it's the professional way to start your program!

### Using Constants

<TerminalDemo>
```python
TASKS_FILE = "tasks.json"  # ALL CAPS means this is a constant
```
</TerminalDemo>

Constants (variables that never change) are written in ALL_CAPS. This makes it easy to change the filename in one place if needed.

### Error Handling

<TerminalDemo>
```python
try:
    index = int(choice) - 1
    # ... do something with index
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a number!")
```
</TerminalDemo>

This prevents crashes when users enter text instead of numbers!

<FunFact title="User Input is Dangerous!">
Never trust user input! Users will:
- Type words when you want numbers
- Press Enter without typing anything
- Type negative numbers
- Try to break your program (accidentally or on purpose)

Always validate and handle errors!
</FunFact>

## Testing Your Project

A good project needs testing! Try these scenarios:

1. **Happy Path** - Everything works normally
   - Add a few tasks
   - View them
   - Complete one
   - Delete one

2. **Edge Cases** - Unusual situations
   - Try to view tasks when none exist
   - Try to complete task #999
   - Enter text when asked for a number
   - Add a task with empty description

3. **Data Persistence** - Does it save/load?
   - Add tasks and exit
   - Run the program again
   - Are your tasks still there?

<Challenge title="Enhance the Task Manager">
Add these features to make the project even better:

1. **Filter by priority** - Show only high priority tasks
2. **Due dates** - Let users add due dates to tasks
3. **Task categories** - Group tasks (Work, Personal, School, etc.)
4. **Statistics** - Show how many tasks are done vs. todo
5. **Clear completed** - Delete all completed tasks at once

Choose at least 2 features to implement!

<details>
<summary>Hint for Statistics</summary>

```python
def show_statistics():
    """Display task statistics"""
    tasks = load_tasks()

    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks to analyze!")
        return

    total = len(tasks)
    completed = sum(1 for task in tasks if task["completed"])
    remaining = total - completed

    print("\n=== STATISTICS ===")
    print(f"Total tasks: {total}")
    print(f"Completed: {completed}")
    print(f"Remaining: {remaining}")
    print(f"Completion rate: {(completed/total)*100:.1f}%")
```
</details>
</Challenge>

## Project Ideas for More Practice

Now that you've built one project, here are more ideas:

### Beginner Projects
1. **Password Generator** - Create random secure passwords
2. **Number Guessing Game** - Computer picks a number, you guess
3. **Simple Calculator** - Does multiple operations with a menu
4. **Word Counter** - Counts words/characters in text files

### Intermediate Projects
1. **Budget Tracker** - Track income and expenses
2. **Study Flashcards** - Quiz yourself on any topic
3. **Habit Tracker** - Track daily habits and streaks
4. **Simple Diary** - Write daily entries with search

### Advanced Projects
1. **Text-Based RPG** - A choose-your-own-adventure game
2. **Grade Manager** - Calculate GPA and track assignments
3. **Recipe Book** - Store and search recipes
4. **URL Shortener** - Create short codes for long URLs

<FunFact title="Build What You Need!">
The best projects solve YOUR problems! Think about:
- What repetitive tasks do you do?
- What information do you want to track?
- What would make your life easier?

Then build it! That's how real software gets created.
</FunFact>

## Best Practices Recap

When building projects, remember:

1. **Plan first, code second** - Outline your functions
2. **Start simple** - Get basic features working first
3. **Test frequently** - Don't write 100 lines before testing
4. **Use functions** - Break code into small, manageable pieces
5. **Handle errors** - Expect users to do unexpected things
6. **Save often** - Both your code AND user data
7. **Comment tricky parts** - Help future you understand

<TerminalDemo>
```python
# Good function structure
def do_something():
    """
    Clear description of what this does.
    """
    # Load data
    data = load_data()

    # Process data
    result = process(data)

    # Save and return
    save_data(result)
    return result
```
</TerminalDemo>
