<FunFact title="Text Adventures Were the First Video Games!">
Before graphics, all video games were text-based! Famous games like "Zork" and "Adventure" were just text and your imagination. Today, games like "AI Dungeon" show that text adventures are still fun and creative!
</FunFact>

## Game Structure Planning

Before you start coding, plan your game! Here's a suggested structure:

<TerminalDemo>
```python
# Main components:

# 1. Player data structure
player = {
    "name": "Hero",
    "health": 100,
    "inventory": [],
    "location": "village",
    "gold": 50
}

# 2. Game world structure
game_world = {
    "village": {
        "name": "Peaceful Village",
        "description": "A quiet village with friendly folk.",
        "items": ["sword", "shield"],
        "exits": ["forest", "cave"]
    },
    "forest": {
        "name": "Dark Forest",
        "description": "Tall trees block out the sun.",
        "items": ["potion"],
        "exits": ["village", "mountain"]
    },
    # ... more locations
}

# 3. Main functions
def create_character()
def save_game(player)
def load_game()
def show_location(location)
def move(direction)
def pickup_item(item)
def show_inventory()
def combat(enemy)
def main_game_loop()
```
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete" mood="teaching">
Remember: **start simple, then expand**! Get the basic structure working first:
1. Create a player
2. Show a location
3. Move between locations
4. Pick up items

Once that works, add combat, save/load, and other features!
</StoryBox>

## Example Starter Code

Here's a skeleton to get you started. **You must expand this significantly!**

<TerminalDemo>
```python

# Game world data

        "items": ["bread", "map"]
    },
    "forest": {
        "name": "Dark Forest",
        "description": "Twisted trees loom over you. Something rustles in the shadows.",
        "exits": {"south": "village", "north": "mountain"},
        "items": ["potion"]

<StoryBox character="python_pete" mood="challenging">
This starter code has basic movement and inventory. But it's missing:
- Combat system
- Enemies
- Win condition
- More locations
- Use items
- Puzzles or challenges

**Your job is to expand it into a complete game!** Make it your own!
</StoryBox>

## Ideas to Expand Your Game

### 1. Add Combat System

<TerminalDemo>
```python
def combat(player, enemy_name):
    """Simple turn-based combat"""
    enemies = {
        "goblin": {"health": 30, "attack": 5, "gold": 10},
        "dragon": {"health": 100, "attack": 20, "gold": 100}
    }

    enemy = enemies[enemy_name].copy()

    print(f"\n⚔️  A {enemy_name} appears!")

    while enemy["health"] > 0 and player["health"] > 0:
        print(f"\nYour HP: {player['health']} | {enemy_name} HP: {enemy['health']}")
        print("1. Attack")
        print("2. Use Potion")
        print("3. Run")

        choice = input("Choose: ")

        if choice == "1":
            damage = 10  # Player attack
            enemy["health"] -= damage
            print(f"You hit for {damage} damage!")

            if enemy["health"] > 0:
                player["health"] -= enemy["attack"]
                print(f"{enemy_name} hits you for {enemy['attack']} damage!")
        # Add more options...

    if player["health"] <= 0:
        print("\n💀 You died! Game Over.")
        return False
    else:
        print(f"\n🎉 You defeated the {enemy_name}!")
        player["gold"] += enemy["gold"]
        return True
```
</TerminalDemo>

### 2. Add Puzzle System

<TerminalDemo>
```python
def riddle_puzzle():
    """A riddle the player must solve"""
    print("\n🧩 A mysterious door blocks your path!")
    print("Answer this riddle to proceed:")
    print("I speak without a mouth and hear without ears.")
    print("I have no body, but come alive with wind. What am I?")

    answer = input("\nYour answer: ").lower()

    if answer == "echo":
        print("\n✓ Correct! The door opens.")
        return True
    else:
        print("\n❌ Wrong! The door remains sealed.")
        return False
```
</TerminalDemo>

### 3. Add Quest System

<TerminalDemo>
```python
# Add to player data:
player["quests"] = {
    "find_crystal": {
        "description": "Find the magic crystal in the cave",
        "completed": False,
        "reward": 50
    }
}

def check_quest(player, quest_id):
    """Check if quest is complete"""
    quest = player["quests"][quest_id]
    if not quest["completed"]:
        # Check completion condition
        if "magic_crystal" in player["inventory"]:
            quest["completed"] = True
            player["gold"] += quest["reward"]
            print(f"\n🎉 Quest Complete! +{quest['reward']} gold")
```
</TerminalDemo>

<Challenge title="Your Final Quest Requirements">
Complete the game with these minimum requirements:

### Must Have (Required)
1. **At least 4 locations** with descriptions
2. **At least 6 items** to collect
3. **Some form of challenge** (combat, puzzles, or meaningful choices)
4. **A clear win condition** - how do you beat the game?
5. **Save/Load system** that works
6. **Death/Game Over** possibility
7. **Help command** that explains how to play

### Should Have (Strongly Recommended)
1. **Combat with at least 2 different enemies**
2. **Health system** with healing
3. **At least one puzzle or riddle**
4. **Gold/currency system**
5. **Item usage** (potions, keys, etc.)

### Could Have (Bonus)
1. Multiple endings based on choices
2. Character stats (strength, intelligence)
3. Shop system
4. Achievement tracking
5. Random encounters
6. Multiple save slots

**Time to Build!** Take your time. Test frequently. Start simple and expand. You've got this!
</Challenge>

<FunFact title="How Long Should This Take?">
Building your first real project might take:
- **2-3 hours** for minimum requirements
- **5-8 hours** for a really good game
- **10+ hours** for something amazing

This is normal! Real projects take time. Professional games take years!

Don't rush - enjoy the process of creating!
</FunFact>

## Testing Your Game

Before you call it complete, test these scenarios:

1. **Fresh Start Test**
   - Start new game
   - Play through to the end
   - Make sure it's winnable!

2. **Save/Load Test**
   - Play partway
   - Save and exit
   - Load game
   - Continue where you left off

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Try invalid commands
   - Try to go invalid directions
   - Try to pick up items that don't exist
   - Test with empty inventory

4. **Death Test**
   - Make sure game over works
   - What happens if player dies?

5. **Win Test**
   - Complete the game
   - Is the ending satisfying?

## Showing Off Your Work

Once your game is complete:

1. **Test it thoroughly**
2. **Add a README** explaining how to play
3. **Get feedback** from friends or family
4. **Improve based on feedback**
5. **Be proud!** You built this!

<TerminalDemo>

- You can manage collections of data
- You can read and write files
- You can save complex data with JSON
- You can build complete, working applications

You're not a beginner anymore. You're a **Python Master**.

The adventure doesn't end here - it's just beginning. The skills you've learned will serve you for years to come. Python opens doors to web development, data science, automation, game creation, and so much more.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Now go forth and build amazing things!

**🐍 May your code be bug-free and your loops be efficient! 🐍**

## Final Notes

**You made it!** This is the last lesson. There is no NextLesson component because this is the end of your Python journey (for now).

Your next steps are up to you. The Python world is vast and full of possibilities. Whatever you choose to build next, remember:

- Start simple, iterate, improve
- Google is your friend (every programmer uses it!)
- Bugs are learning opportunities
- The best way to learn is by building

**Congratulations, Python Master! 🎉**
