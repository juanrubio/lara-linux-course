# Lists: Your Digital Backpack

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Welcome back, code champion! I'm Python Pete the Snake, and I've got something AWESOME to show you today!

  You know how your backpack holds multiple things - books, pencils, snacks? Well, Python has something similar called LISTS!

  Lists let you store multiple items in one container. Instead of creating 100 variables for 100 students' names, you can just use ONE list! Cool, right?
</StoryBox>

## What's a List?

A **list** is like a digital backpack that can hold multiple items. You can store numbers, text, or even other lists!

Think of it like this:
- A variable holds ONE thing (a water bottle)
- A list holds MANY things (your whole backpack!)

<FunFact>
  In Python, lists can hold different types of data at the same time! You can mix numbers, text, and booleans all in one list. That's like having a backpack that holds books AND snacks AND games!
</FunFact>

## Creating Your First List

Creating a list is super easy! You use square brackets `[]` and separate items with commas:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# A list of favorite games
favorite_games = ["Minecraft", "Roblox", "Fortnite", "Among Us"]

# A list of lucky numbers
lucky_numbers = [7, 13, 21, 42]

# An empty list (we'll fill it later!)
my_tasks = []

print(favorite_games)
# Output: ['Minecraft', 'Roblox', 'Fortnite', 'Among Us']`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Notice how we use square brackets? That's Python's way of saying "Hey, this is a list!"

  The comma separates each item, like putting dividers in your backpack to keep things organized.
</StoryBox>

## Accessing Items: The Index System

Here's where it gets interesting! Each item in a list has a position number called an **index**. But there's a twist...

**Python counts starting from ZERO!** (I know, programmers are weird like that!)

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
#         0        1         2         3
```

To get an item, use the list name and the index in square brackets:

<TerminalDemo>
{`fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Get the first item (index 0)
print(fruits[0])
# Output: apple

# Get the second item (index 1)
print(fruits[1])
# Output: banana

# Get the last item
print(fruits[3])
# Output: date`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Why does counting start at 0? It's because of how computers store data in memory. The first item is "zero steps away" from the start! Weird but true!
</FunFact>

## Negative Indexing: Counting Backwards!

Python has a cool trick - you can use negative numbers to count from the END of the list!

<TerminalDemo>
{`fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
#         -4      -3        -2       -1

# Get the last item
print(fruits[-1])
# Output: date

# Get the second-to-last item
print(fruits[-2])
# Output: cherry`}
</TerminalDemo>

Think of it like this:
- Positive numbers: count from the START (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- Negative numbers: count from the END (-1, -2, -3...)

## Changing List Items

Lists are **mutable**, which means you can change them after creating them!

<TerminalDemo>
{`inventory = ["sword", "shield", "potion", "map"]
print(inventory)
# Output: ['sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'map']

# You used the potion! Replace it with a key
inventory[2] = "key"
print(inventory)
# Output: ['sword', 'shield', 'key', 'map']`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Getting the Length of a List

Want to know how many items are in your list? Use `len()` (short for "length"):

<TerminalDemo>
{`high_scores = [1000, 850, 720, 650, 500]
number_of_scores = len(high_scores)
print(f"We have {number_of_scores} high scores!")
# Output: We have 5 high scores!

# Works with any list!
empty_list = []
print(len(empty_list))
# Output: 0`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  The `len()` function is super useful! You'll use it ALL the time when working with lists. It's like asking your backpack "How many items are you carrying?"
</StoryBox>

## Practice Time!

## Real-World Uses

Lists are EVERYWHERE in programming:

- **Shopping apps**: List of items in your cart
- **Music apps**: Your playlist is a list of songs
- **Games**: List of enemies, inventory items, levels
- **School**: List of students in a class
- **Social media**: List of your friends or followers

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What index is the FIRST item in a Python list?",
    options: ["1", "0", "-1", "first"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first item is at index 0!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you access the last item using negative indexing?",
    options: ["list[0]", "list[last]", "list[-1]", "list[end]"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Use index -1 to get the last item in any list!"
  },
  {
    question: "What function tells you how many items are in a list?",
    options: ["size()", "count()", "length()", "len()"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "The len() function returns the length (number of items) in a list!"
  },
  {
    question: "What punctuation marks are used to create a list?",
    options: ["Parentheses ()", "Curly braces {}", "Square brackets []", "Angle brackets <>"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Square brackets [] are used to create lists in Python!"
  }
]} />

## Command Cheat Sheet

| Code | What It Does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `[item1, item2]` | Create a list | `games = ["Mario", "Zelda"]` |
| `list[0]` | Get first item | `games[0]` returns "Mario" |
| `list[-1]` | Get last item | `games[-1]` returns "Zelda" |
| `list[i] = value` | Change an item | `games[0] = "Sonic"` |
| `len(list)` | Get list length | `len(games)` returns 2 |

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  You're doing AMAZING! You now know how to store multiple items in lists and access them by their index!

  But here's the thing - what if you want to do something with EVERY item in a list? Like print all 100 Pokemon names? You wouldn't want to write 100 print statements, right?

  That's where LOOPS come in! Get ready to learn the most powerful tool in programming...
