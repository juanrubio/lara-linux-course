# Comparisons and Logic

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Hey there, logic master in training! Last lesson we learned to make simple decisions with if statements. But real life is rarely simple!

  What if you need to check TWO things at once? Like "Is it the weekend AND is it sunny?" or "Do I have pizza OR tacos for dinner?"

  Today we're learning **logical operators** - the secret sauce that makes your programs REALLY smart! Get ready to level up your decision-making powers!
</StoryBox>

## What are Boolean Values?

Before we dive into logic, let's talk about **booleans** - the building blocks of decisions.

A boolean is a special type that can only be `True` or `False` (notice the capital letters!):

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> is_raining = True
>>> is_sunny = False
>>>
>>> print(is_raining)
True
>>> print(type(is_sunny))
<class 'bool'>`}
</TerminalDemo>

Every comparison creates a boolean:

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> age = 13
>>> is_teenager = age >= 13
>>> print(is_teenager)
True
>>>
>>> print(5 > 10)
False
>>> print(5 == 5)
True`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Booleans are named after George Boole, a mathematician who invented Boolean algebra in the 1800s. He created the math of True and False - and now it runs every computer!
</FunFact>

## The AND Operator

The `and` operator checks if BOTH conditions are true. If even one is false, the whole thing is false.

Think of it like needing TWO keys to open a treasure chest - you need BOTH!

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> age = 13
>>> has_permission = True
>>>
>>> if age >= 13 and has_permission:
...     print("You can play the game!")
... else:
...     print("Sorry, you can't play.")
...
You can play the game!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Truth table for `and`:

| Condition A | Condition B | A and B |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| True | True | **True** |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | False |
| False | False | False |

**Both must be True for the result to be True!**

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> # Checking if a number is in a range
>>> number = 50
>>>
>>> if number >= 1 and number <= 100:
...     print("Number is between 1 and 100!")
...
Number is between 1 and 100!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## The OR Operator

The `or` operator checks if AT LEAST ONE condition is true. If any condition is true, the whole thing is true!

Think of it like having TWO doors - you only need ONE to be unlocked!

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> day = "Saturday"
>>>
>>> if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
...     print("It's the weekend!")
...     print("Time to relax!")
... else:
...     print("It's a weekday - back to work!")
...
It's the weekend!
Time to relax!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Truth table for `or`:

| Condition A | Condition B | A or B |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| True | True | **True** |
| True | False | **True** |
| False | True | **True** |
| False | False | False |

**Only ONE needs to be True for the result to be True!**

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> # Checking valid user input
>>> answer = input("Continue? (yes/y): ")
Continue? (yes/y): y
>>>
>>> if answer == "yes" or answer == "y":
...     print("Great! Let's continue!")
...
Great! Let's continue!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## The NOT Operator

The `not` operator flips the value - it turns True into False and False into True!

Think of it like opposite day - everything means the opposite!

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> is_raining = False
>>>
>>> if not is_raining:
...     print("Let's go to the park!")
... else:
...     print("Let's stay inside!")
...
Let's go to the park!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Truth table for `not`:

| Condition | not Condition |
|-----------|---------------|
| True | False |
| False | True |

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> logged_in = False
>>>
>>> if not logged_in:
...     print("Please log in first!")
...
Please log in first!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  The `not` operator is like saying "the opposite of" - if something is True, `not` makes it False, and vice versa. It's super useful when you want to check if something is NOT the case!
</StoryBox>

## Combining Multiple Operators

You can combine `and`, `or`, and `not` to create complex conditions!

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> age = 15
>>> has_ticket = True
>>> is_weekend = True
>>>
>>> if (age >= 13 and has_ticket) and is_weekend:
...     print("Welcome to the teen movie night!")
... else:
...     print("Sorry, you can't attend.")
...
Welcome to the teen movie night!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Use parentheses `()` to group conditions and make your logic clear! Python evaluates what's in parentheses first, just like in math!
</FunFact>

## Real-World Example - Game Login

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> print("=== Game Login System ===\\n")
=== Game Login System ===

>>> username = input("Username: ")
Username: pete123
>>> password = input("Password: ")
Password: dragon
>>> age = int(input("Age: "))
Age: 14
>>>
>>> # Check multiple conditions
>>> correct_user = username == "pete123"
>>> correct_pass = password == "dragon"
>>> old_enough = age >= 13
>>>
>>> if correct_user and correct_pass and old_enough:
...     print("\\n✓ Login successful!")
...     print("Welcome to the game!")
... elif not correct_user or not correct_pass:
...     print("\\n✗ Invalid username or password!")
... elif not old_enough:
...     print("\\n✗ You must be 13 or older!")
... else:
...     print("\\n✗ Access denied!")
...
✓ Login successful!
Welcome to the game!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Operator Precedence

When you mix operators, Python follows these rules (highest to lowest priority):

1. `not` (evaluated first)
2. `and` (evaluated second)
3. `or` (evaluated last)

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> # Without parentheses
>>> True or False and False
True

>>> # With parentheses to change order
>>> (True or False) and False
False`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  When in doubt, use parentheses! They make your code clearer and prevent bugs. It's better to be explicit than to rely on remembering operator precedence!
</StoryBox>

## Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Range Check**
```python
# Check if number is between 1 and 10
if number >= 1 and number <= 10:
    print("In range!")
```

**Pattern 2: Multiple Valid Options**
```python
# Check if answer is yes or y
if answer == "yes" or answer == "y" or answer == "YES":
    print("Confirmed!")
```

**Pattern 3: Exclusion Check**
```python
# Check if NOT a specific value
if not (age < 0 or age > 120):
    print("Valid age!")
```

**Pattern 4: Complex Permission Check**
```python
# Must be admin OR (member AND verified)
if is_admin or (is_member and is_verified):
    print("Access granted!")
```

## The != Operator Revisited

Remember `!=` (not equal)? It's actually a shorthand for `not ==`:

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> password = "abc123"
>>>
>>> # These two are the same:
>>> if password != "":
...     print("Password not empty!")
...
Password not empty!
>>>
>>> if not password == "":
...     print("Password not empty!")
...
Password not empty!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Use `!=` - it's cleaner and more readable!

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What does the 'and' operator require?",
    options: ["At least one condition to be True", "Both conditions to be True", "No conditions to be True", "Exactly one condition to be True"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The 'and' operator requires BOTH conditions to be True. If even one is False, the whole thing is False!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'True or False' evaluate to?",
    options: ["True", "False", "Error", "None"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "With 'or', you only need ONE condition to be True. Since the first is True, the result is True!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'not True' evaluate to?",
    options: ["True", "False", "None", "Error"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The 'not' operator flips the value - 'not True' becomes False!"
  },
  {
    question: "Which operator has the highest precedence?",
    options: ["or", "and", "not", "They're all equal"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "'not' is evaluated first, then 'and', then 'or'. But use parentheses to be clear!"
  }
]} />

## Truth Tables - Quick Reference

**AND - Both must be True**
```
True  and True  → True
True  and False → False
False and True  → False
False and False → False
```

**OR - At least one True**
```
True  or True  → True
True  or False → True
False or True  → True
False or False → False
```

**NOT - Flip the value**
```
not True  → False
not False → True
```

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Here's a memory trick:

  - **AND** is strict - it's like a bouncer that needs to check TWO IDs
  - **OR** is flexible - it's like a door with TWO keys, you only need ONE
  - **NOT** is a flip-flopper - it always says the opposite!
</StoryBox>

## Advanced Example - Weather Decision

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> print("=== Weather Activity Planner ===\\n")
=== Weather Activity Planner ===

>>> temp = int(input("Temperature (°C): "))
Temperature (°C): 25
>>> is_raining = input("Is it raining? (yes/no): ")
Is it raining? (yes/no): no
>>> is_windy = input("Is it windy? (yes/no): ")
Is it windy? (yes/no): no
>>>
>>> # Convert to booleans
>>> raining = is_raining == "yes"
>>> windy = is_windy == "yes"
>>>
>>> # Make recommendations
>>> if temp >= 20 and temp <= 30 and not raining and not windy:
...     print("\\nPerfect day for the beach!")
... elif temp >= 15 and not raining:
...     print("\\nGood day for a park visit!")
... elif raining and temp >= 15:
...     print("\\nGood day for indoor activities!")
... else:
...     print("\\nStay cozy at home!")
...
Perfect day for the beach!`}
</TerminalDemo>
