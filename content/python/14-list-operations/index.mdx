# List Operations: Power Up Your Lists!

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Alright, code master! You know how to create lists and loop through them. But what if you want to ADD items? REMOVE items? SORT them?

  That's where list methods come in! Think of them as special powers your lists have. It's like giving your lists superpowers!

  Let's learn how to manipulate lists like a pro!
</StoryBox>

## Adding Items: append() and insert()

### append() - Add to the End

The `append()` method adds an item to the END of a list:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Start with a shopping list
shopping_list = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
print(shopping_list)
# Output: ['milk', 'eggs', 'bread']

# Remember to buy cheese!
shopping_list.append("cheese")
print(shopping_list)
# Output: ['milk', 'eggs', 'bread', 'cheese']

# Add multiple items
shopping_list.append("apples")
shopping_list.append("cookies")
print(shopping_list)
# Output: ['milk', 'eggs', 'bread', 'cheese', 'apples', 'cookies']`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  append() is one of the MOST used list methods! Every time you add something to a cart on Amazon or add a friend on social media, append() is probably happening behind the scenes!
</FunFact>

### insert() - Add at a Specific Position

Want to add something at a specific spot? Use `insert()`:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# High score list
high_scores = [1000, 850, 720]
print(high_scores)
# Output: [1000, 850, 720]

# You got 900 points! Insert it at position 1 (second place)
high_scores.insert(1, 900)
print(high_scores)
# Output: [1000, 900, 850, 720]

# Insert at the beginning (position 0)
high_scores.insert(0, 1500)
print(high_scores)
# Output: [1500, 1000, 900, 850, 720]`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Removing Items: remove(), pop(), and clear()

### remove() - Remove by Value

Remove the FIRST occurrence of a specific item:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Game inventory
inventory = ["sword", "potion", "shield", "potion", "map"]
print(inventory)
# Output: ['sword', 'potion', 'shield', 'potion', 'map']

# Use the first potion
inventory.remove("potion")
print(inventory)
# Output: ['sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'map']
# Notice: Only the FIRST potion was removed!

# Try to remove something that doesn't exist - ERROR!
# inventory.remove("diamond")  # This would crash!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Be careful with remove()! If the item doesn't exist, Python throws an error!

  Always check if the item exists first using `if item in list:` before removing!
</StoryBox>

### pop() - Remove by Position

Remove an item at a specific position AND get it back:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Playlist
songs = ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C", "Song D"]
print(songs)
# Output: ['Song A', 'Song B', 'Song C', 'Song D']

# Remove and get the last song
last_song = songs.pop()
print(f"Removed: {last_song}")
# Output: Removed: Song D
print(songs)
# Output: ['Song A', 'Song B', 'Song C']

# Remove song at position 1
second_song = songs.pop(1)
print(f"Removed: {second_song}")
# Output: Removed: Song B
print(songs)
# Output: ['Song A', 'Song C']`}
</TerminalDemo>

### clear() - Remove Everything

Delete all items at once:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Shopping cart
cart = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
print(cart)
# Output: ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']

# Changed your mind? Clear the cart!
cart.clear()
print(cart)
# Output: []`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Organizing Lists: sort() and reverse()

### sort() - Arrange in Order

Sort lists alphabetically or numerically:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Sort numbers
scores = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]
print("Before:", scores)
# Output: Before: [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]

scores.sort()
print("After:", scores)
# Output: After: [78, 85, 88, 92, 95]

# Sort in reverse (highest first)
scores.sort(reverse=True)
print("Descending:", scores)
# Output: Descending: [95, 92, 88, 85, 78]`}
</TerminalDemo>

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Sort words alphabetically
names = ["Zoe", "Alex", "Maya", "Ben"]
print("Before:", names)
# Output: Before: ['Zoe', 'Alex', 'Maya', 'Ben']

names.sort()
print("After:", names)
# Output: After: ['Alex', 'Ben', 'Maya', 'Zoe']`}
</TerminalDemo>

### reverse() - Flip the List

Reverse the order of items:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Countdown
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Before:", numbers)
# Output: Before: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.reverse()
print("After:", numbers)
# Output: After: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  sort() and reverse() change the list PERMANENTLY! If you want a sorted copy without changing the original, use sorted(list) instead - it returns a new list!
</FunFact>

## Searching and Counting

### index() - Find Position

Find where an item is located:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Find the position of an item
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

position = fruits.index("cherry")
print(f"Cherry is at position {position}")
# Output: Cherry is at position 2

# Try to find something that doesn't exist - ERROR!
# position = fruits.index("grape")  # This would crash!`}
</TerminalDemo>

### count() - Count Occurrences

Count how many times an item appears:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Vote counting
votes = ["pizza", "tacos", "pizza", "burger", "pizza", "tacos"]

pizza_votes = votes.count("pizza")
tacos_votes = votes.count("tacos")
burger_votes = votes.count("burger")

print(f"Pizza: {pizza_votes} votes")
print(f"Tacos: {tacos_votes} votes")
print(f"Burger: {burger_votes} votes")

# Output:
# Pizza: 3 votes
# Tacos: 2 votes
# Burger: 1 votes`}
</TerminalDemo>

### in - Check if Item Exists

Check if an item is in the list:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Check inventory
inventory = ["sword", "shield", "potion"]

if "sword" in inventory:
    print("You have a sword!")
# Output: You have a sword!

if "dragon" not in inventory:
    print("You don't have a dragon!")
# Output: You don't have a dragon!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Useful List Functions

### len() - Get List Length

<TerminalDemo>
{`students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"]
num_students = len(students)
print(f"There are {num_students} students")
# Output: There are 4 students`}
</TerminalDemo>

### min() and max() - Get Smallest/Largest

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Find best and worst score
test_scores = [78, 92, 85, 95, 88]

lowest = min(test_scores)
highest = max(test_scores)

print(f"Lowest score: {lowest}")
print(f"Highest score: {highest}")

# Output:
# Lowest score: 78
# Highest score: 95`}
</TerminalDemo>

### sum() - Add All Numbers

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Calculate total points
points = [10, 25, 15, 30, 20]
total_points = sum(points)
average = total_points / len(points)

print(f"Total points: {total_points}")
print(f"Average: {average}")

# Output:
# Total points: 100
# Average: 20.0`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Combining Lists

You can join lists together using `+`:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Combine lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
veggies = ["carrot", "broccoli"]

food = fruits + veggies
print(food)
# Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'carrot', 'broccoli']

# Repeat lists using *
echo = ["hello"] * 3
print(echo)
# Output: ['hello', 'hello', 'hello']`}
</TerminalDemo>

## List Slicing: Get Parts of a List

Get a portion of a list using slicing:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Slicing lists
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Get items 2-5 (position 2 up to but not including 5)
slice1 = numbers[2:5]
print(slice1)
# Output: [2, 3, 4]

# Get first 3 items
first_three = numbers[:3]
print(first_three)
# Output: [0, 1, 2]

# Get last 3 items
last_three = numbers[-3:]
print(last_three)
# Output: [7, 8, 9]

# Get every other item
every_other = numbers[::2]
print(every_other)
# Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  List slicing is SUPER powerful! The format is list[start:stop:step]

  - start: where to begin (included)
  - stop: where to end (NOT included)
  - step: how many to skip

  It's like saying "Give me items from here to there, every X steps!"

|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `list.append(x)` | Add x to end | `nums.append(5)` |
| `list.insert(i, x)` | Add x at position i | `nums.insert(0, 10)` |
| `list.remove(x)` | Remove first x | `nums.remove(5)` |
| `list.pop()` | Remove and return last item | `last = nums.pop()` |
| `list.pop(i)` | Remove and return item at i | `item = nums.pop(2)` |

| `x in list` | Check if x exists | `if 5 in nums:` |
| `len(list)` | Get list length | `len(nums)` |
| `sum(list)` | Sum all numbers | `sum(nums)` |
| `min(list)` | Get smallest | `min(nums)` |
