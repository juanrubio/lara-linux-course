# What Are Functions?

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Welcome to Chapter 4, code architect! You've been writing code line by line, but now it's time to learn one of the most powerful concepts in programming!

  Imagine you're building with LEGO blocks. Instead of finding individual pieces every time, wouldn't it be great to have pre-built sections you could use over and over? That's exactly what functions are!
</StoryBox>

## The Magic of Reusable Code

Think about your favorite video game. When you press the jump button, the character jumps. You don't have to explain HOW to jump every time - the game just knows! That's because jumping is a **function** - a set of instructions packaged together with a name.

**A function is:**
- A reusable block of code
- A named set of instructions
- Something you can use over and over
- A way to organize your code

<FunFact>
  The word "function" comes from mathematics! Just like a math function takes an input and gives an output (like f(x) = x + 2), programming functions work the same way!
</FunFact>

## Why Functions Are Awesome

Imagine you're writing a program that needs to greet users. Without functions:

```python
print("=" * 30)
print("Welcome to CodeQuest!")
print("=" * 30)

# Later in your code...
print("=" * 30)
print("Welcome to CodeQuest!")
print("=" * 30)

# And again...
print("=" * 30)
print("Welcome to CodeQuest!")
print("=" * 30)
```

That's a lot of repeated code! With a function:

```python
def show_greeting():
    print("=" * 30)
    print("Welcome to CodeQuest!")
    print("=" * 30)

# Now just call it whenever you need it!
show_greeting()
# Later...
show_greeting()
# Easy!
show_greeting()
```

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Think of functions like recipes in a cookbook! Once you write down a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, you don't need to figure it out every time you want to bake. Just follow the recipe!

  Same with code - write the function once, use it forever!
</StoryBox>

## Built-in Functions You Already Know

Surprise! You've been using functions this whole time! Python comes with many built-in functions:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# print() is a function!
print("Hello, World!")
# Output: Hello, World!

# input() is a function!
name = input("What's your name? ")
# Waits for user input

# len() is a function!
message = "Python rocks!"
length = len(message)
print(length)
# Output: 13

# type() is a function!
print(type(42))
# Output: <class 'int'>

# str(), int(), float() are functions!
number = int("100")
print(number)
# Output: 100`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Functions Are Like Machines

Think of a function like a machine in a factory:

```
         INPUT
           |
           v
    [  FUNCTION  ]
           |
           v
         OUTPUT
```

For example, the `len()` function:
- **Input:** A string like "hello"
- **Machine:** Counts the letters
- **Output:** The number 5

```python
word = "hello"
result = len(word)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

<FunFact>
  Python has over 60 built-in functions! We'll learn the most useful ones. You can see them all by typing `dir(__builtins__)` in Python - but don't worry, you don't need to memorize them all!
</FunFact>

## Three Types of Functions

### 1. Built-in Functions
Functions that come with Python (like `print()`, `len()`, `input()`)

### 2. Functions from Libraries
Functions others have written that you can import (we'll learn this later!)

### 3. Your Own Functions
Functions YOU create to solve YOUR problems! This is what we'll focus on!

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Here's the best part: when you create your own functions, you become a creator of tools! You're not just using Python - you're EXTENDING it with your own ideas!

  That's real programming power!
</StoryBox>

## Real-World Function Examples

Functions are everywhere in programming:

| Function Purpose | Real Example |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Calculate score | `calculate_game_score()` |
| Validate password | `is_password_strong()` |
| Send email | `send_welcome_email()` |
| Save file | `save_to_file()` |
| Draw shape | `draw_circle()` |
| Get weather | `get_current_temperature()` |

## Practice: Identify the Functions

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What is a function?",
    options: ["A type of loop", "A reusable block of code with a name", "A variable", "A data type"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A function is a reusable block of code that you can call by its name!"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these is a built-in Python function?",
    options: ["calculate()", "print()", "hello()", "run()"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "print() is a built-in Python function that displays output!"
  },
  {
    question: "Why are functions useful?",
    options: ["They make programs slower", "They help you reuse code instead of repeating it", "They only work once", "They make code longer"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Functions let you write code once and reuse it many times, making your programs cleaner and easier to maintain!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does len() do?",
    options: ["Deletes text", "Counts the length of something", "Prints to screen", "Creates a loop"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "len() is a function that returns the length (number of items/characters) of something!"
  }
