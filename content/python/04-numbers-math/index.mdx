# Numbers and Math

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Ready to turn your computer into a super-powered calculator?

  Python is AMAZING at math! It can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and do way more complex calculations in the blink of an eye!

  Today, you'll learn how to use Python like a mathematical wizard! Let's go!
</StoryBox>

## Two Types of Numbers

Python has two main types of numbers:

### 1. Integers (Whole Numbers)
```python
age = 12
score = 100
lives = 3
year = 2024
```

Integers are whole numbers with no decimal point. They can be positive or negative!

### 2. Floats (Decimal Numbers)
```python
price = 9.99
temperature = 98.6
pi = 3.14159
height = 5.8
```

Floats have decimal points. They're called "floating-point numbers."

<FunFact>
  Why "float"? Because the decimal point can "float" to different positions! 12.34, 123.4, and 1234.0 all store the same amount of data.
</FunFact>

## Basic Math Operators

Python uses symbols for math operations. These are called **operators**!

| Operator | Name | Example | Result |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| `+` | Addition | `5 + 3` | `8` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 4` | `6` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `7 * 3` | `21` |
| `/` | Division | `20 / 4` | `5.0` |
| `**` | Power (Exponent) | `2 ** 3` | `8` |
| `%` | Modulo (Remainder) | `10 % 3` | `1` |
| `//` | Floor Division | `10 // 3` | `3` |

Let's try them all!

## Addition and Subtraction

```python
print(5 + 3)    # 8
print(10 - 4)   # 6
print(100 + 25) # 125
print(50 - 30)  # 20
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`8
6
125
20`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Using Variables
```python
apples = 5
oranges = 3
total_fruit = apples + oranges
print("Total fruit:", total_fruit)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Total fruit: 8`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Multiplication and Division

```python
print(7 * 3)   # 21
print(20 / 4)  # 5.0
print(12 * 12) # 144
print(100 / 10) # 10.0
```

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Notice that division always gives you a float (decimal number), even if the answer is a whole number! 20 / 4 = 5.0, not 5.
</StoryBox>

### Real Example: Sharing Candy
```python
total_candy = 24
friends = 4
candy_per_friend = total_candy / friends
print("Each friend gets", candy_per_friend, "pieces")
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Each friend gets 6.0 pieces`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Special Operators

### Power (**)
Use `**` to raise a number to a power:

```python
print(2 ** 3)   # 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
print(5 ** 2)   # 5 * 5 = 25
print(10 ** 3)  # 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`8
25
1000`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Modulo (%)
The modulo operator gives you the REMAINDER after division:

```python
print(10 % 3)  # 10 ÷ 3 = 3 remainder 1
print(15 % 4)  # 15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3
print(20 % 5)  # 20 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 0
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`1
3
0`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Modulo is super useful! You can use it to check if a number is even (number % 2 == 0) or odd (number % 2 == 1)!
</FunFact>

### Floor Division (//)
Regular division keeps decimals. Floor division throws them away:

```python
print(10 / 3)   # 3.333333...
print(10 // 3)  # 3 (no decimals!)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`3.3333333333333335
3`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Order of Operations

Python follows the same math rules you learned in school! Remember **PEMDAS**?

- **P**arentheses
- **E**xponents
- **M**ultiplication
- **D**ivision
- **A**ddition
- **S**ubtraction

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4)     # 14 (multiply first!)
print((2 + 3) * 4)   # 20 (parentheses first!)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`14
20`}
</TerminalDemo>

Always use parentheses to make your calculations clear:

```python
# Calculating average
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
num3 = 30
average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
print("Average:", average)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Average: 20.0`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Updating Variables with Math

You can use math to update variables!

```python
score = 0
print("Starting score:", score)

score = score + 10
print("After level 1:", score)

score = score + 15
print("After level 2:", score)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Starting score: 0
After level 1: 10
After level 2: 25`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Shortcut Operators

Python has shortcuts for updating variables:

```python
score = 0

score += 10    # Same as: score = score + 10
score -= 5     # Same as: score = score - 5
score *= 2     # Same as: score = score * 2
score /= 3     # Same as: score = score / 3
```

| Shortcut | Long Version | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `x += 5` | `x = x + 5` | Add 5 to x |
| `x -= 3` | `x = x - 3` | Subtract 3 from x |
| `x *= 2` | `x = x * 2` | Multiply x by 2 |
| `x /= 4` | `x = x / 4` | Divide x by 4 |

## Mixing Integers and Floats

What happens when you mix integers and floats?

```python
print(10 + 2.5)    # 12.5 (becomes float)
print(5 * 3.0)     # 15.0 (becomes float)
print(7 - 1.5)     # 5.5 (becomes float)
```

**Rule:** When you mix integers and floats, the result is always a float!

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Shopping Cart
```python
item1 = 12.99
item2 = 7.50
item3 = 4.99
tax = 0.08  # 8% tax

subtotal = item1 + item2 + item3
tax_amount = subtotal * tax
total = subtotal + tax_amount

print("Subtotal: $", subtotal)
print("Tax: $", tax_amount)
print("Total: $", total)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Subtotal: $ 25.48
Tax: $ 2.0384
Total: $ 27.5184`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Example 2: Converting Temperature
```python
celsius = 25
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
print(celsius, "°C is", fahrenheit, "°F")
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`25 °C is 77.0 °F`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Example 3: Game Level System
```python
xp = 450
xp_per_level = 100

current_level = xp // xp_per_level
leftover_xp = xp % xp_per_level

print("Level:", current_level)
print("XP until next level:", xp_per_level - leftover_xp)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Level: 4
XP until next level: 50`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using ^ for power
```python
# Wrong:
print(2 ^ 3)  # This is XOR, not power!

# Right:
print(2 ** 3)
```

### Mistake 2: Integer division in Python 2 style
```python
# Python 3 always gives float for /
print(10 / 3)  # 3.333... (not 3!)

# Use // for integer division
print(10 // 3)  # 3
```

### Mistake 3: Forgetting order of operations
```python
# Wrong thinking:
result = 10 + 5 * 2  # Someone might think: 15 * 2 = 30

# Reality:
result = 10 + 5 * 2  # Actually: 10 + 10 = 20 (multiply first!)

# Use parentheses to be clear:
result = (10 + 5) * 2  # Now it's 30!
```

## Math Operator Cheat Sheet

```python
# Basic operations
print(5 + 3)     # Addition: 8
print(10 - 4)    # Subtraction: 6
print(7 * 3)     # Multiplication: 21
print(20 / 4)    # Division: 5.0

# Special operations
print(2 ** 3)    # Power: 8
print(10 % 3)    # Modulo: 1
print(10 // 3)   # Floor division: 3

# Shortcuts
x = 10
x += 5           # x is now 15
x -= 3           # x is now 12
x *= 2           # x is now 24
x /= 4           # x is now 6.0
```
