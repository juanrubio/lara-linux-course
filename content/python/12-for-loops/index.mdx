# For Loops: Automate Everything!

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Alright code warrior, it's time to learn one of the MOST POWERFUL tools in all of programming!

  Imagine you have to write "I will learn Python" 100 times. Would you really type it 100 times? NO WAY! That's what loops are for!

  Loops let you repeat actions automatically. It's like having a robot helper that can do boring tasks for you!
</StoryBox>

## What's a Loop?

A **loop** is code that repeats itself. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it ONCE and tell Python "do this X times!"

Think of it like:
- Brushing your teeth: You move the brush back and forth many times
- Jumping rope: You jump over and over
- Eating cereal: Spoonful after spoonful until the bowl is empty

In programming, we loop through lists, numbers, and more!

<FunFact>
  Without loops, Instagram would need to write separate code for EVERY photo in your feed! Instead, they use a loop: "For each photo, display it on screen." One loop handles millions of photos!
</FunFact>

## Your First For Loop

The `for` loop goes through each item in a list, one at a time:

<TerminalDemo>
{`favorite_snacks = ["pizza", "cookies", "ice cream", "chips"]

for snack in favorite_snacks:
    print(f"I love {snack}!")

# Output:
# I love pizza!
# I love cookies!
# I love ice cream!
# I love chips!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Let's break this down:
- `for` - starts the loop
- `snack` - a temporary variable that holds each item
- `in favorite_snacks` - tells Python which list to loop through
- The indented code runs for EACH item

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  See that indentation? That's SUPER important! Python uses spaces to know what code belongs inside the loop.

  No spaces = not part of the loop
  Indented = part of the loop

  Most programmers use 4 spaces (or press Tab once).
</StoryBox>

## The Magic of For Loops

Here's why for loops are amazing. Without a loop:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# The boring way (yuck!)
print("Welcome student 1!")
print("Welcome student 2!")
print("Welcome student 3!")
print("Welcome student 4!")
print("Welcome student 5!")
# ... imagine doing this for 100 students!`}
</TerminalDemo>

With a loop:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# The smart way!
students = ["Alex", "Sam", "Jordan", "Taylor", "Riley"]

for student in students:
    print(f"Welcome {student}!")

# Output:
# Welcome Alex!
# Welcome Sam!
# Welcome Jordan!
# Welcome Taylor!
# Welcome Riley!`}
</TerminalDemo>

ONE loop handles 5 students, 100 students, or 1,000 students. That's the power!

## Looping Through Numbers with range()

What if you want to repeat something a specific number of times? Use `range()`!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Print numbers 0 to 4
for number in range(5):
    print(number)

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4`}
</TerminalDemo>

**Important:** `range(5)` gives you 5 numbers, but starting from 0! So you get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

### Range with Start and Stop

You can control where range starts and stops:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Count from 1 to 5
for num in range(1, 6):
    print(num)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5

# Why 6? Because range stops BEFORE the end number!`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Range with Steps

You can even skip numbers!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Count by 2s from 0 to 10
for num in range(0, 11, 2):
    print(num)

# Output:
# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10

# The 2 at the end means "step by 2"`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  The range() function doesn't actually create a list - it creates a special object that generates numbers as needed. This saves memory when you're counting to a million!
</FunFact>

## Nested Loops: Loops Inside Loops!

You can put loops inside other loops! This is called **nesting**:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Print a multiplication table
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        result = i * j
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {result}")
    print("---")  # Separator

# Output:
# 1 x 1 = 1
# 1 x 2 = 2
# 1 x 3 = 3
# ---
# 2 x 1 = 2
# 2 x 2 = 4
# 2 x 3 = 6
# ---
# 3 x 1 = 3
# 3 x 2 = 6
# 3 x 3 = 9
# ---`}
</TerminalDemo>

For each number in the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely!

## Doing Math with Loops

Loops are perfect for calculations:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Add up all numbers from 1 to 10
total = 0
for number in range(1, 11):
    total = total + number
    print(f"Current total: {total}")

print(f"Final sum: {total}")

# Output:
# Current total: 1
# Current total: 3
# Current total: 6
# ... (and so on)
# Final sum: 55`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Using the Index Too

Sometimes you need both the item AND its position. Use `enumerate()`!

<TerminalDemo>
{`pokemon = ["Pikachu", "Charizard", "Bulbasaur"]

for index, name in enumerate(pokemon):
    print(f"#{index + 1}: {name}")

# Output:
# #1: Pikachu
# #2: Charizard
# #3: Bulbasaur`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  The enumerate() function is super handy! It gives you both the index (position) and the value (item) at the same time.

  We add 1 to the index because most humans prefer counting from 1, not 0!
</StoryBox>

## Real-World Uses

For loops are used EVERYWHERE:

- **Netflix**: Loop through all movies to show you recommendations
- **Instagram**: Loop through photos to display your feed
- **Games**: Loop through all enemies to move them
- **Email**: Loop through contacts to send group messages
- **Music apps**: Loop through playlist to play songs

## Quick Quiz!

    question: "What does this loop do? for i in range(3):",
    options: ["Runs 3 times", "Runs 4 times", "Creates a list", "Prints 3"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "range(3) generates 0, 1, 2 - that's 3 numbers, so the loop runs 3 times!"

## Loop Cheat Sheet

| Code | What It Does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `for item in list:` | Loop through list | `for game in games:` |
| `range(n)` | Numbers 0 to n-1 | `range(5)` → 0,1,2,3,4 |
| `range(start, stop)` | Numbers from start to stop-1 | `range(1, 6)` → 1,2,3,4,5 |
| `range(start, stop, step)` | Numbers with custom step | `range(0, 10, 2)` → 0,2,4,6,8 |
| `enumerate(list)` | Get index and item | `for i, item in enumerate(list):` |

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Congratulations! You've unlocked one of the most powerful skills in programming!

  For loops let you automate repetitive tasks, process lists of data, and write code that scales from 10 items to 10 million items!

  But wait... what if you don't know HOW MANY times to loop? What if you need to keep going until something happens?

  That's where WHILE loops come in. Let's learn about them next!
</StoryBox>

## What's Next?

Ready to learn another type of loop? In the next lesson, you'll discover **while loops** - loops that keep going until a condition becomes false!
