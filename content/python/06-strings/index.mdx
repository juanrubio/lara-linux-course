# Strings

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Hey there, code adventurer! Python Pete here, ready to help you master the art of working with text!

  You know how we've been using print() to display messages? Well, all that text we've been printing are called STRINGS! And today, we're going to become string wizards!

  Think of strings like magic spells - they're how we make our programs talk, write messages, and communicate with users!
</StoryBox>

## What is a String?

A **string** is just a fancy word for text. Any letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces that you want to store or display are strings!

In Python, you create strings by wrapping text in quotes:

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

>>> print('Python is awesome!')
Python is awesome!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Why are they called "strings"? Because text is like a string of characters beaded together - each letter, number, or symbol is one bead on the string!
</FunFact>

## Single Quotes vs Double Quotes

Python is cool - you can use EITHER single quotes `'` or double quotes `"` for strings. They work exactly the same!

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> message1 = "Hello!"
>>> message2 = 'Hello!'
>>> print(message1)
Hello!
>>> print(message2)
Hello!`}
</TerminalDemo>

But why have both? Because sometimes you need quotes INSIDE your string:

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> print("Python Pete says, 'Code is fun!'")
Python Pete says, 'Code is fun!'

>>> print('My favorite symbol is the "hashtag"')
My favorite symbol is the "hashtag"`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  See the trick? Use double quotes on the outside when you need single quotes inside, and vice versa! It's like nesting boxes!
</StoryBox>

## String Concatenation - Gluing Strings Together

Want to combine strings? Use the `+` operator! This is called **concatenation** (big word alert!).

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> first_name = "Ada"
>>> last_name = "Lovelace"
>>> full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
>>> print(full_name)
Ada Lovelace`}
</TerminalDemo>

You can also repeat strings using `*`:

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> laugh = "ha"
>>> print(laugh * 5)
hahahahaha

>>> cheer = "Hip "
>>> print(cheer * 3 + "Hooray!")
Hip Hip Hip Hooray!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Notice we added a space " " between the names? Without it, we'd get "AdaLovelace" - strings stick together EXACTLY as you tell them to!
</FunFact>

## Multi-Line Strings

Need a string that spans multiple lines? Use three quotes (`"""` or `'''`):

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> poem = """
... Roses are red,
... Violets are blue,
... Python is awesome,
... And so are you!
... """
>>> print(poem)

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Python is awesome,
And so are you!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Special Characters - The Escape Artist

What if you need BOTH types of quotes in the same string? Use a backslash `\\` to "escape" special characters:

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> print("Python Pete says, \\"Code is fun!\\"")
Python Pete says, "Code is fun!"

>>> print('It\\'s a beautiful day!')
It's a beautiful day!`}
</TerminalDemo>

Other useful escape sequences:

| Escape | What it does | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `\\n` | New line | `"Line 1\\nLine 2"` |
| `\\t` | Tab space | `"Name:\\tPete"` |
| `\\\\` | Actual backslash | `"C:\\\\Users"` |

<TerminalDemo>
{`>>> print("First Line\\nSecond Line\\nThird Line")
First Line
Second Line
Third Line`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "Which of these is a valid string in Python?",
    options: ['"Hello World"', "'Python Rocks'", '"""Multi-line"""', "All of the above"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "All of these are valid! Python accepts single quotes, double quotes, and triple quotes for strings."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'Hi' * 3 produce?",
    options: ["HiHiHi", "Hi Hi Hi", "Hi3", "Error"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The * operator repeats strings. 'Hi' * 3 produces 'HiHiHi' with no spaces!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you create a string that spans multiple lines?",
    options: ["Use single quotes", "Use double quotes", "Use triple quotes", "Use parentheses"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Triple quotes (\"\"\" or ''') allow strings to span multiple lines!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does \\n do in a string?",
    options: ["Makes text bold", "Creates a new line", "Adds a space", "Deletes a character"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "\\n is the newline character - it moves to a new line when printed!"
  }

## String Tips & Tricks

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Here are some pro tips for working with strings:

  1. **Be Consistent**: Pick either single or double quotes and stick with it (unless you need both!)
  2. **Watch Your Spaces**: When concatenating, remember to add spaces where needed
  3. **Use Variables**: Store strings in variables to reuse them easily
  4. **Triple Quotes for Long Text**: Perfect for paragraphs, poems, or ASCII art!

## String Cheat Sheet

| Operation | Syntax | Example | Result |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Create string | `"text"` or `'text'` | `"Hello"` | Hello |
| Concatenate | `string1 + string2` | `"Hi" + " there"` | Hi there |
| Repeat | `string * number` | `"Go! " * 3` | Go! Go! Go! |
| Multi-line | `"""text"""` | `"""Line 1\nLine 2"""` | Two lines |
| New line | `\n` | `"First\nSecond"` | Two lines |
| Tab | `\t` | `"Name:\tPete"` | Name:    Pete |

## What's Next?

Now that you can work with text, it's time to learn how to GET text FROM users! In the next lesson, we'll learn about the `input()` function - how to make your programs interactive!
