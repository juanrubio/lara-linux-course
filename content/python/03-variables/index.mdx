# Variables: Giving Your Computer a Memory

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Alright, coding champion! Now we're getting to the really cool stuff!

  Imagine if you had to remember every single number, name, and piece of information in your head while writing a program. Impossible, right?

  That's where VARIABLES come in! They're like labeled boxes where you can store information and use it later. Let's explore!
</StoryBox>

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a container that stores a value. Think of it like:

- A **labeled box** where you keep things
- A **nickname** for a piece of data
- A **name tag** you put on information

Here's your first variable:

```python
name = "Alex"
```

Now Python remembers that `name` equals "Alex"!

You can use it anytime:

```python
name = "Alex"
print("Hello,", name)
print("Nice to meet you,", name)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Hello, Alex
Nice to meet you, Alex`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Variables are called "variables" because they can VARY (change)! You can store different values in them as your program runs.
</FunFact>

## Creating Variables

Creating a variable is super easy! Just use the equals sign:

```python
age = 12
favorite_color = "blue"
lives = 3
score = 0
```

The pattern is always:
```
variable_name = value
```

## Using Variables

Once you create a variable, you can use it anywhere:

```python
username = "CodeMaster"
points = 100

print("Welcome back,", username)
print("You have", points, "points!")
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Welcome back, CodeMaster
You have 100 points!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Variables Can Change!

That's the magic of variables - you can change them!

```python
score = 0
print("Starting score:", score)

score = 10
print("Score after level 1:", score)

score = 25
print("Score after level 2:", score)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Starting score: 0
Score after level 1: 10
Score after level 2: 25`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  See? The variable `score` can hold different values at different times! It's like updating what's written on a whiteboard - erase the old value, write the new one!
</StoryBox>

## Types of Data You Can Store

Variables can hold different types of information:

### 1. Text (Strings)
```python
name = "Sarah"
message = "Hello, World!"
favorite_game = "Minecraft"
```

### 2. Numbers (Integers)
```python
age = 12
lives = 3
level = 1
```

### 3. Decimal Numbers (Floats)
```python
price = 9.99
temperature = 72.5
height = 4.8
```

### 4. True/False (Booleans)
```python
is_playing = True
game_over = False
has_key = True
```

## Variable Naming Rules

Python has rules for naming variables. Follow these and you'll be golden!

### ✅ GOOD Variable Names:
```python
player_name = "Alex"
max_score = 100
user_age = 12
total_points = 500
```

### ❌ BAD Variable Names:
```python
# Can't start with a number
1st_place = "Winner"  # ERROR!

# Can't have spaces
my name = "Alex"  # ERROR!

# Can't use special Python words
print = "Hello"  # ERROR! 'print' is reserved
```

### The Golden Rules:

1. **Start with a letter or underscore** (`_`)
2. **Only use letters, numbers, and underscores**
3. **No spaces** (use underscore instead: `my_variable`)
4. **Case matters** (`name` and `Name` are different!)
5. **Be descriptive** (`score` is better than `s`)

<FunFact>
  Python programmers use "snake_case" for variables - words are lowercase and separated by underscores, like a snake slithering! Example: `player_high_score`
</FunFact>

## Good vs. Bad Variable Names

| Bad Name | Why It's Bad | Good Name |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| `x` | Not descriptive | `player_score` |
| `a` | Too vague | `age` |
| `thing1` | Not clear | `username` |
| `ABCD` | Confusing | `high_score` |

Always choose names that explain what the variable holds!

## Multiple Variables

You can create many variables:

```python
first_name = "Luna"
last_name = "Star"
age = 12
grade = 7
favorite_subject = "Science"

print(first_name, last_name, "is", age, "years old")
print("Favorite subject:", favorite_subject)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Luna Star is 12 years old
Favorite subject: Science`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Swapping Variables

Here's a cool trick! You can swap values between variables:

```python
player1 = "Alex"
player2 = "Jordan"

print("Before swap:", player1, player2)

# The magic swap!
player1, player2 = player2, player1

print("After swap:", player1, player2)
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`Before swap: Alex Jordan
After swap: Jordan Alex`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Practice Time!

## Real-World Example: Game Status

Let's create a simple game status using variables:

```python
# Player information
player_name = "DragonSlayer"
health = 100
mana = 50
level = 5
gold = 250

# Display status
print("==== PLAYER STATUS ====")
print("Name:", player_name)
print("Level:", level)
print("Health:", health, "HP")
print("Mana:", mana, "MP")
print("Gold:", gold, "coins")
print("=======================")
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`==== PLAYER STATUS ====
Name: DragonSlayer
Level: 5
Health: 100 HP
Mana: 50 MP
Gold: 250 coins
=======================`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Quiz Time!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What symbol do you use to create a variable?",
    options: ["+", "=", "*", "=>"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Use the equals sign (=) to assign a value to a variable!"
  },
  {
    question: "Which is a valid variable name?",
    options: ["2cool", "my-name", "player_score", "print"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "player_score follows all the rules: starts with a letter, uses underscore for spaces, no special Python words!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can variables change their value?",
    options: ["Yes", "No", "Sometimes", "Only on Tuesdays"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Yes! That's why they're called variables - they can vary (change)!"
  },
  {
    question: "What's wrong with: my name = 'Alex'?",
    options: ["Nothing", "Has a space", "Wrong quotes", "Too short"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Variable names can't have spaces! Use my_name instead."
  }
]} />

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Using a variable before creating it
```python
# Wrong:
print(score)  # Error! score doesn't exist yet!

# Right:
score = 100
print(score)
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting quotes for text
```python
# Wrong:
name = Alex  # Python thinks Alex is a variable!

# Right:
name = "Alex"
```

### Mistake 3: Confusing assignment with comparison
```python
age = 12  # This SETS age to 12
# Later we'll learn: age == 12 checks if age equals 12
```

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Variables are one of the MOST important concepts in programming! Every program uses them!

  Think of them as your program's memory. Without variables, programs would be super limited!

  Next, we'll learn how to do MATH with variables. Get ready to build a calculator!

## What You've Learned!

You now know how to:
- Create variables with the `=` operator
- Store different types of data
- Use variables in print statements
- Follow variable naming rules
- Change variable values
- Create multiple variables

## Variable Cheat Sheet

```python
# Creating variables
name = "Alex"
age = 12
score = 100
is_active = True

# Using variables
print(name)
print("Score:", score)

# Changing variables
score = 150
print("New score:", score)

# Multiple variables
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
```
