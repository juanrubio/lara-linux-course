# Quest: Number Guessing Game

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Congratulations, code champion! You've learned SO much in Chapter 2:
  - Working with strings
  - Getting user input
  - Making decisions with if-else
  - Using logical operators

  Now it's time for your QUEST! You're going to build a real game - a Number Guessing Game!

  The computer will pick a secret number, and the player has to guess it. You'll give them hints to help them find it. This is going to be AWESOME!
</StoryBox>

## The Quest Mission

Build a Number Guessing Game with these features:

1. The secret number is between 1 and 20
2. The player gets multiple guesses
3. After each guess, give hints: "Too high!", "Too low!", or "Correct!"
4. Keep track of how many guesses they've made
5. Make it fun with colorful messages!

<FunFact>
  Number guessing games are a classic! They teach the concept of "binary search" - a super efficient way to find things that programmers use all the time!
</FunFact>

## Part 1: Setting Up the Game

Let's start by creating the game structure and getting the first guess.

<Challenge
  id="quest2-part1"
  title="Game Setup"
  description="Create the welcome message and get the secret number"
  steps={[
    {
      command: 'print("=" * 40)',
      hint: "Create a decorative line"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("🎮 WELCOME TO THE GUESSING GAME! 🎮")',
      hint: "Show a welcome message"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("=" * 40)',
      hint: "Create another decorative line"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("\\nI\\'m thinking of a number between 1 and 20.")',
      hint: "Explain the game rules"
    },
    {
      command: 'print("Can you guess what it is?\\n")',
      hint: "Ask the player to guess"
    },
    {
      command: 'secret_number = 7',
      hint: "Set the secret number (we'll use 7 for testing)"
    }
  ]}
  xp={20}
/>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Great start! We're using 7 as our secret number for now. Later, you'll learn how to make the computer pick a random number!

  Notice how we used `print("=" * 40)` to create a decorative line? That's 40 equal signs in a row - cool, right?
</StoryBox>

## Part 2: Getting the First Guess

Now let's get the player's first guess and check if it's correct!

<Challenge
  id="quest2-part2"
  title="First Guess"
  description="Get user input and check if they guessed correctly"
  steps={[
    {
      command: 'guess_count = 1',
      hint: "Start counting guesses"
    },
    {
      command: 'guess = int(input("Guess #1: "))',
      hint: "Get the first guess and convert to number"
    },
    {
      command: 'if guess == secret_number:\n    print("🎉 CORRECT! You got it!")\nelse:\n    print("❌ Wrong! Try again!")',
      hint: "Check if the guess is correct"
    }
  ]}
  xp={20}
/>

## Part 3: Adding Helpful Hints

Let's make it more helpful by telling the player if their guess is too high or too low!

<Challenge
  id="quest2-part3"
  title="Smart Hints"
  description="Give the player hints about their guess"
  steps={[
    {
      command: 'guess = int(input("Guess #1: "))',
      hint: "Get the guess"
    },
    {
      command: 'if guess == secret_number:\n    print("🎉 CORRECT! You won!")\nelif guess > secret_number:\n    print("📉 Too high! Try a smaller number.")\nelse:\n    print("📈 Too low! Try a bigger number.")',
      hint: "Give specific hints based on the guess"
    }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Excellent! Now players get real feedback! This uses the `elif` statement to check three possibilities:
  1. Guess equals the secret (WIN!)
  2. Guess is higher than the secret (too high)
  3. Guess is lower than the secret (too low)
</StoryBox>

## Part 4: Multiple Guesses

Let's give the player three chances to guess the number!

<Challenge
  id="quest2-part4"
  title="Three Chances"
  description="Allow three guesses with hints"
  steps={[
    {
      command: 'guess_count = 0\nmax_guesses = 3',
      hint: "Track guesses and set maximum"
    },
    {
      command: 'guess1 = int(input("Guess #1: "))\nguess_count = 1\nif guess1 == secret_number:\n    print("🎉 You won in " + str(guess_count) + " guess!")\nelif guess1 > secret_number:\n    print("📉 Too high!")\nelse:\n    print("📈 Too low!")',
      hint: "Handle first guess"
    },
    {
      command: 'if guess1 != secret_number:\n    guess2 = int(input("\\nGuess #2: "))\n    guess_count = 2\n    if guess2 == secret_number:\n        print("🎉 You won in " + str(guess_count) + " guesses!")\n    elif guess2 > secret_number:\n        print("📉 Too high!")\n    else:\n        print("📈 Too low!")',
      hint: "Handle second guess if first was wrong"
    }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

## Complete Game Code

Here's the complete game putting it all together! Type this into a Python file:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Number Guessing Game - Complete Version
print("=" * 40)
print("🎮 WELCOME TO THE GUESSING GAME! 🎮")
print("=" * 40)
print("\\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20.")
print("You have 3 chances to guess it!\\n")

# Set up the game
secret_number = 7
guess_count = 0
max_guesses = 3
won = False

# Guess 1
guess = int(input("Guess #1: "))
guess_count = 1

if guess == secret_number:
    print("🎉 AMAZING! You got it on the first try!")
    won = True
elif guess > secret_number:
    print("📉 Too high! Try again.")
else:
    print("📈 Too low! Try again.")

# Guess 2 (only if first guess was wrong)
if not won and guess_count < max_guesses:
    guess = int(input("\\nGuess #2: "))
    guess_count = 2

    if guess == secret_number:
        print("🎉 CORRECT! You won in " + str(guess_count) + " guesses!")
        won = True
    elif guess > secret_number:
        print("📉 Too high! One more try!")
    else:
        print("📈 Too low! One more try!")

# Guess 3 (only if still haven't won)
if not won and guess_count < max_guesses:
    guess = int(input("\\nGuess #3 (last chance!): "))
    guess_count = 3

    if guess == secret_number:
        print("🎉 CORRECT! You won in " + str(guess_count) + " guesses!")
        won = True
    else:
        print("❌ Sorry, you're out of guesses!")
        print("The secret number was " + str(secret_number))

# Final message
print("\\n" + "=" * 40)
if won:
    print("🏆 VICTORY! You're a guessing master!")
else:
    print("Better luck next time!")
print("=" * 40)`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Testing Your Game

Test your game with different scenarios:

1. **Win on first try**: Guess 7 immediately
2. **Win on second try**: Guess 10, then 7
3. **Win on third try**: Guess 15, then 10, then 7
4. **Lose the game**: Guess 1, then 2, then 3 (all wrong)

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Testing is SUPER important! Professional programmers spend lots of time testing their code to make sure it works in all situations. Try to break your game - that's how you make it better!
</StoryBox>

## Challenge: Enhance Your Game!

Ready for extra credit? Try adding these features:

### Enhancement 1: Better Range Hints
Instead of just "too high" or "too low", give more specific hints:
- If guess is within 3 of the secret: "You're getting warm!"
- If guess is far away: "You're cold!"

### Enhancement 2: Input Validation
Check if the player's guess is between 1 and 20:
```python
if guess < 1 or guess > 20:
    print("Hey! That's not between 1 and 20!")
```

### Enhancement 3: Play Again Option
At the end, ask if they want to play again!

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "Why do we use int(input()) in the guessing game?",
    options: ["To make input faster", "To convert string input to a number", "To validate the input", "To make it look professional"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "input() always returns a string. We use int() to convert it to a number so we can compare it with our secret number!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'elif' do in the guessing game?",
    options: ["Ends the program", "Checks another condition if the first was false", "Creates a loop", "Stores a variable"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "elif (else if) checks another condition when the previous if was false. It's perfect for checking multiple possibilities!"
  },
  {
    question: "Why do we use 'guess > secret_number' instead of 'guess >= secret_number'?",
    options: ["It's faster", "They're the same thing", "We already checked equality with ==", "It's required by Python"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Since we already checked if guess == secret_number with if, we know they're not equal. So > is enough - we don't need >= !"
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'won = False' do?",
    options: ["Makes the player lose", "Creates a flag to track game state", "Ends the game", "Resets the game"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "It's a boolean flag that tracks whether the player has won. We check this to decide if they should keep guessing!"
  }
]} />

## What's Next?

You've conquered Chapter 2, but your journey is far from over! In Chapter 3, you'll learn about **LOOPS** - how to make your code repeat actions automatically.

Imagine not having to write three separate guess blocks - what if you could tell Python "Keep asking for guesses until they get it right"? That's the power of loops!
