# Creating Functions

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Time to build your own tools! Creating functions is like crafting your own superpowers. Once you master this, you'll be able to organize code like a pro!

  The magic word you need is `def` - short for "define". Let's learn how to use it!
</StoryBox>

## The Function Recipe

Every function has the same basic structure:

```python
def function_name():
    # Code goes here
    # Indented by 4 spaces
    print("This is inside the function!")
```

Let's break it down:
1. **`def`** - The keyword that says "I'm defining a function!"
2. **`function_name`** - The name you choose (like a spell name!)
3. **`()`** - Parentheses (we'll use these for parameters soon!)
4. **`:`** - The colon says "here comes the function code!"
5. **Indented code** - Everything indented belongs to the function

<FunFact>
  The word "def" is short for "define". Python loves short keywords! Just like "int" is short for "integer" and "str" is short for "string".
</FunFact>

## Your First Function

Let's create a simple greeting function:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# DEFINING the function (writing the recipe)
def greet():
    print("Hello, brave coder!")
    print("Welcome to the Python world!")

# CALLING the function (using the recipe)
greet()
# Output:
# Hello, brave coder!
# Welcome to the Python world!

# You can call it as many times as you want!
greet()
greet()
greet()`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Important: Defining a function doesn't run it! It's like writing a recipe in a cookbook - the food doesn't appear until you actually COOK it!

  - **def** = Write the recipe
  - **function_name()** = Cook the food (run the code)
</StoryBox>

## Naming Your Functions

Function names follow the same rules as variables:

**Good Names:**
```python
def say_hello():        # Good: descriptive
def calculate_score():  # Good: clear action
def show_menu():        # Good: tells what it does
def draw_circle():      # Good: verb + noun
```

**Bad Names:**
```python
def x():               # Bad: meaningless
def DoTheThing():      # Bad: wrong style (use lowercase)
def 2cool():           # Bad: starts with number
def my-function():     # Bad: can't use dashes
```

**Naming Convention:**
- Use lowercase letters
- Use underscores between words (snake_case)
- Use verbs to describe actions
- Be descriptive but concise

<FunFact>
  Professional programmers say a good function name should tell you what it does without needing to read the code inside. It's like a good book title - it tells you what to expect!
</FunFact>

## Functions Can Do Anything!

Let's create some useful functions:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# A function that draws a line
def draw_line():
    print("=" * 40)

# A function that shows a menu
def show_menu():
    print("1. New Game")
    print("2. Load Game")
    print("3. Quit")

# A function that celebrates
def celebrate():
    print("🎉 Congratulations! 🎉")
    print("You're becoming a Python master!")

# Using our functions
draw_line()
show_menu()
draw_line()
celebrate()`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Functions Within Functions

Functions can call OTHER functions! This is super powerful:

<TerminalDemo>
{`def print_header():
    print("=" * 30)
    print("    PYTHON QUEST    ")
    print("=" * 30)

def print_footer():
    print("=" * 30)
    print("  Thanks for playing!  ")
    print("=" * 30)

def show_welcome_screen():
    print_header()
    print()
    print("Welcome, adventurer!")
    print("Your quest begins now!")
    print()
    print_footer()

# Call just one function, it calls the others!
show_welcome_screen()`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  This is like building with bigger LEGO sets! You combine small functions (small LEGO pieces) into larger functions (bigger creations). This is how professional programmers organize complex programs!
</StoryBox>

## The Power of Organization

Compare these two programs. Which is easier to understand?

**Without Functions:**
```python
print("=" * 30)
print("GAME STARTING")
print("=" * 30)
player_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Welcome, {player_name}!")
print("=" * 30)
print("GAME OVER")
print("=" * 30)
```

**With Functions:**
```python
def show_header():
    print("=" * 30)
    print("GAME STARTING")
    print("=" * 30)

def get_player_info():
    player_name = input("Enter your name: ")
    print(f"Welcome, {player_name}!")

def show_footer():
    print("=" * 30)
    print("GAME OVER")
    print("=" * 30)

# Main program - easy to read!
show_header()
get_player_info()
show_footer()
```

The second version is like a story with clear chapters!

## Practice Time!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting the Colon
```python
# WRONG - Missing colon
def greet()
    print("Hello")

# RIGHT
def greet():
    print("Hello")
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Indentation
```python
# WRONG - Not indented
def greet():
print("Hello")

# RIGHT - Indented with 4 spaces
def greet():
    print("Hello")
```

### Mistake 3: Calling Before Defining
```python
# WRONG - Calling before it's defined
greet()
def greet():
    print("Hello")

# RIGHT - Define first, call later
def greet():
    print("Hello")
greet()
```

<FunFact>
  Python reads your code from top to bottom. So you have to teach Python what a function does BEFORE you try to use it. It's like explaining the rules of a game before playing!
</FunFact>

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What keyword do you use to create a function?",
    options: ["function", "def", "create", "func"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The 'def' keyword (short for define) is used to create functions in Python!"
  },
  {
    question: "What must come after the function name?",
    options: ["Semicolon ;", "Period .", "Parentheses ()", "Brackets []"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Parentheses () must come after the function name, followed by a colon!"
  },
  {
    question: "How many times can you call a function after defining it?",
    options: ["Only once", "Twice", "Three times", "As many times as you want!"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Once you define a function, you can call it as many times as you need!"
  },
  {
    question: "What's wrong with this code: def 123function():",
    options: ["Nothing", "Function names can't start with numbers", "Missing parentheses", "Wrong keyword"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Function names must start with a letter or underscore, not a number!"
  }
]} />

## Build Your Own Function Library

Try creating these functions on your own:

1. **draw_box()** - Prints a box made of asterisks
2. **show_divider()** - Prints a line to separate sections
3. **countdown()** - Prints "3... 2... 1... GO!"
4. **show_python_logo()** - Prints ASCII art of Python logo

<StoryBox character="python_pete">
  Remember: Every expert programmer started by writing simple functions like these. The more you practice, the more powerful your functions become!

  You're building the foundation for amazing programs. Keep going!
</StoryBox>

## What's Next?

Your functions are pretty cool, but they all do the SAME thing every time. What if you want to make them flexible? That's where parameters come in!
