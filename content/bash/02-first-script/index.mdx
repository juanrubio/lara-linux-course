# Your First Script

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  This is it! The moment you become a script writer!

  Just like how you wrote your first Python program, today you'll write your first shell script. But shell scripts are different - they're like giving your computer a to-do list!

  Ready to create some automation magic? Let's go!
</StoryBox>

## What is a .sh File?

Shell scripts are saved in files with the `.sh` extension (which stands for "shell"). These files contain commands that Bash will execute, one after another!

Think of it like:
- `.py` files are for Python programs
- `.txt` files are for plain text
- `.sh` files are for shell scripts!

## Creating Your First Script

Let's create a simple script that says hello! We'll use a text editor you already know - `nano`.

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ nano hello.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

This opens the nano editor with a new file called `hello.sh`.

## The Magic Shebang Line

Every shell script should start with a special line called the **shebang** (pronounced "shuh-BANG"). It looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

This line tells Linux: "Hey! Use Bash to run this script!"

Let's break it down:
- `#!` - The shebang characters (hash + exclamation)
- `/bin/bash` - The path to the Bash program

<FunFact>
  The shebang is also called a "hashbang" or "pound bang." The name comes from combining "hash" (#) and "bang" (!)!
</FunFact>

## Writing Your First Script

In the nano editor, type this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
echo "This is my first shell script!"
echo "I'm learning Bash scripting!"
```

Then save it:
1. Press `Ctrl + O` to save
2. Press `Enter` to confirm
3. Press `Ctrl + X` to exit

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Notice that `echo` command? It's like Python's `print()` - it displays text on the screen!

  In Bash, we use `echo` instead of `print()`. Same idea, different name!
</StoryBox>

## Understanding the Script

Let's look at each line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ↑ This tells Linux to use Bash

echo "Hello, World!"
# ↑ The echo command displays text
```

**Important parts:**
- `#!/bin/bash` - Always the first line (the shebang)
- `echo` - The command that displays text
- `"text"` - Your message in quotes

## Comments in Shell Scripts

You can add notes to your scripts using comments. Comments start with `#` (except for the shebang):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment - Bash ignores it!
echo "Hello!"  # You can also put comments after commands

# Comments help you remember what your script does
echo "Comments are super useful!"
```

<FunFact>
  Professional programmers write lots of comments! It helps them remember what their code does when they look at it months later.
</FunFact>

## Running Your Script (The Wrong Way First!)

Let's try to run the script:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied`}
</TerminalDemo>

Oh no! Permission denied! Why?

Because by default, files are NOT executable. You need to tell Linux "this file should be allowed to run!"

Don't worry - we'll learn how to fix this in lesson 4! For now, there's another way...

## Running Scripts with bash

Even without making it executable, you can run it by telling Bash explicitly:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash hello.sh
Hello, World!
This is my first shell script!
I'm learning Bash scripting!`}
</TerminalDemo>

It works! The `bash` command reads your script and runs all the commands inside!

## Try Different Messages!

Modify your script to say different things:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "======================================"
echo "     WELCOME TO BASH SCRIPTING!"
echo "======================================"
echo ""
echo "My name is [YOUR NAME]"
echo "Today is a great day to code!"
echo ""
echo "This script was created by me!"
```

Run it again:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash hello.sh
======================================
     WELCOME TO BASH SCRIPTING!
======================================

My name is [YOUR NAME]
Today is a great day to code!

This script was created by me!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Multiple Commands in One Script

The power of scripts is running MANY commands at once! Let's try:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running multiple commands..."
echo ""

# Show current directory
echo "Current directory:"
pwd

echo ""

# List files
echo "Files in this directory:"
ls

echo ""

# Show current user
echo "Current user:"
whoami

echo ""
echo "All done!"
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash info.sh
Running multiple commands...

Current directory:
/home/pi

Files in this directory:
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  hello.sh  info.sh

Current user:
pi

All done!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  See how powerful this is? Instead of typing pwd, then ls, then whoami separately, you just type `bash info.sh` and ALL those commands run automatically!

  This is the power of automation!
</StoryBox>

## Creating a System Info Script

Let's make something really cool - a script that shows useful system information!

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "================================"
echo "   SYSTEM INFORMATION REPORT"
echo "================================"
echo ""

echo "Computer name:"
hostname

echo ""
echo "Today's date:"
date

echo ""
echo "Disk space:"
df -h /

echo ""
echo "Memory usage:"
free -h

echo ""
echo "================================"
echo "     Report Complete!"
echo "================================"
```

<FunFact>
  System administrators use scripts like this to monitor hundreds or even thousands of computers at once!
</FunFact>

## Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them!)

### Mistake 1: Forgetting the Shebang
```bash
# Wrong:
echo "Hello"

# Right:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello"
```

### Mistake 2: Typos in Commands
```bash
# Wrong:
ecko "Hello"  # typo in 'echo'

# Right:
echo "Hello"
```

### Mistake 3: Mismatched Quotes
```bash
# Wrong:
echo "Hello World'

# Right:
echo "Hello World"
```

## Echo vs Print

If you're coming from Python, remember:

| Python | Bash |
|--------|------|
| `print("Hello")` | `echo "Hello"` |
| `print(42)` | `echo 42` |
| `print("Hi", "there")` | `echo "Hi there"` |

Both do the same thing - display text!

## Practice Challenge: Weather Report

Create a script called `weather.sh` that displays a creative weather report:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "================================"
echo "   TODAY'S WEATHER REPORT"
echo "================================"
echo ""
echo "Location: Raspberry Pi Kingdom"
echo "Temperature: 72°F"
echo "Conditions: Perfectly Coded"
echo "Forecast: 100% chance of learning!"
echo ""
echo "This weather report was generated"
echo "by a shell script!"
echo ""
echo "================================"
```

Get creative! Add your own details!
