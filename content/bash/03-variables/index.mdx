# Variables in Bash

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Alright, script wizard! Now things get REALLY interesting!

  You already know about variables from Python, right? Well, Bash has variables too! But they work a little differently.

  Variables let you store information and reuse it throughout your script. It's like giving your script a memory!
</StoryBox>

## What Are Variables?

Variables are like labeled boxes that hold information. You can:
- Put data in the box (assign a value)
- Look at what's in the box (use the variable)
- Change what's in the box (reassign)

In Python, you did this:
```python
name = "Betty"
print(name)
```

In Bash, it's similar but with a few twists!

## Creating Variables in Bash

Here's how you create a variable in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Betty"
```

**Important rules:**
- NO spaces around the `=` sign!
- Variable names are usually lowercase or UPPERCASE
- No special characters (only letters, numbers, and underscores)

<FunFact>
  Why no spaces? Because Bash treats spaces as separators between commands and arguments. If you write `name = "Betty"`, Bash thinks you're trying to run a command called "name"!
</FunFact>

## Using Variables - The $ Symbol

To USE a variable (get its value), you need the dollar sign `$`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Betty"
echo $name
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash script.sh
Betty`}
</TerminalDemo>

Think of `$` as "get the value of this variable."

## Your First Variable Script

Let's create a complete script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create variables
name="Betty"
age=12
hobby="coding"

# Use the variables
echo "Hello! My name is $name"
echo "I am $age years old"
echo "I love $hobby!"
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash intro.sh
Hello! My name is Betty
I am 12 years old
I love coding!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  See how the variables get replaced with their values? The $ tells Bash "replace this with the variable's value!"

  This is super powerful because you can change one variable at the top of your script, and it changes everywhere!
</StoryBox>

## Common Mistakes with Variables

### Mistake 1: Spaces Around =
```bash
# Wrong:
name = "Betty"  # This won't work!

# Right:
name="Betty"
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting the $
```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Betty"

# Wrong:
echo "My name is name"  # Prints: My name is name

# Right:
echo "My name is $name"  # Prints: My name is Betty
```

### Mistake 3: Using Special Characters
```bash
# Wrong:
my-name="Betty"     # Hyphens not allowed
my.name="Betty"     # Dots not allowed

# Right:
my_name="Betty"     # Underscores are fine!
myname="Betty"      # No separators is fine too!
```

## Quoting: Double vs Single Quotes

Bash has TWO types of quotes, and they work differently!

### Double Quotes: Variables Work!
```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Betty"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash test.sh
Hello, Betty!`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Single Quotes: Variables DON'T Work!
```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Betty"
echo 'Hello, $name!'
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash test.sh
Hello, $name!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Single quotes tell Bash "treat everything literally - don't replace variables!" This is useful when you actually want to display the $ symbol!
</FunFact>

## Numbers in Variables

Variables can hold numbers too!

```bash
#!/bin/bash

age=12
next_year=13

echo "I am $age years old"
echo "Next year I'll be $next_year"
```

Want to do math? Use double parentheses `$(( ))`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

age=12
next_year=$((age + 1))

echo "I am $age years old"
echo "Next year I'll be $next_year"
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash age.sh
I am 12 years old
Next year I'll be 13`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Math Operations

You can do calculations in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

num1=10
num2=5

sum=$((num1 + num2))
difference=$((num1 - num2))
product=$((num1 * num2))
quotient=$((num1 / num2))

echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $difference"
echo "Product: $product"
echo "Quotient: $quotient"
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash math.sh
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Using Command Output in Variables

Here's something SUPER cool - you can store the output of commands in variables!

```bash
#!/bin/bash

current_user=$(whoami)
current_dir=$(pwd)
today=$(date +%A)

echo "User: $current_user"
echo "Directory: $current_dir"
echo "Today is: $today"
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ bash info.sh
User: pi
Directory: /home/pi
Today is: Friday`}
</TerminalDemo>

The `$( )` syntax runs the command and captures its output!

## Variable Naming Conventions

Professional scripters follow these naming styles:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Lowercase for regular variables
name="Betty"
age=12

# UPPERCASE for constants (values that don't change)
MAX_USERS=100
PI=3.14159

# Underscores for multi-word names
first_name="Betty"
last_name="Basher"
favorite_color="blue"
```

## Building a Personal Info Script

Let's combine everything:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Personal information
first_name="Betty"
last_name="Script Sorceress"
age=12
hobby="automation"

# System information
username=$(whoami)
computer=$(hostname)
today=$(date +%B\ %d,\ %Y)

# Display banner
echo "=================================="
echo "     PERSONAL INFO CARD"
echo "=================================="
echo ""
echo "Name: $first_name $last_name"
echo "Age: $age years old"
echo "Hobby: $hobby"
echo ""
echo "System Info:"
echo "- Username: $username"
echo "- Computer: $computer"
echo "- Date: $today"
echo ""
echo "=================================="
```

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Now you're thinking like a programmer! Notice how we organize the variables at the top?

  This makes it super easy to update. Change your name once at the top, and it updates everywhere in the script!

## Creative Challenge: About Me Script

Create a script called `about_me.sh` that introduces you:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your information (customize these!)
name="Your Name"
age=12
grade=7
school="Your School"
favorite_subject="Computer Science"
dream_job="Software Developer"
superpower="Creating awesome scripts"

# Calculate some fun facts
days_alive=$((age * 365))
years_until_adult=$((18 - age))

# Display your card
echo "╔════════════════════════════════════════╗"
echo "║         ALL ABOUT ME!                  ║"
echo "╔════════════════════════════════════════╗"
echo ""
echo "Name: $name"
echo "Age: $age years ($days_alive days alive!)"
echo "Grade: $grade"
echo "School: $school"
echo ""
echo "Favorite Subject: $favorite_subject"
echo "Dream Job: $dream_job"
echo "Superpower: $superpower"
echo ""
echo "Years until adult: $years_until_adult"
echo ""
echo "╚════════════════════════════════════════╝"
```

## Comparing Bash and Python Variables

If you know Python, here's the comparison:

| Concept | Python | Bash |
|---------|--------|------|
| Create variable | `name = "Betty"` | `name="Betty"` |
| Use variable | `print(name)` | `echo $name` |
| Math | `x = 5 + 3` | `x=$((5 + 3))` |
| Command output | `import os; x = os.getcwd()` | `x=$(pwd)` |

## What You've Learned!

Congratulations! You can now:
- Create variables in Bash
- Use variables with the $ symbol
- Understand the difference between double and single quotes
- Do math with variables
- Store command output in variables
- Follow naming conventions

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Awesome work! Variables are the KEY to making powerful, flexible scripts!

  Now you can write scripts that store information, do calculations, and adapt to different situations!

  Next up - we'll learn how to make your scripts EXECUTABLE so you can run them with just `./script.sh`!
</StoryBox>

## Command Reference

| Code | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `name="Betty"` | Create a variable (no spaces!) |
| `$name` | Use a variable's value |
| `echo "$name"` | Display with double quotes (variables work) |
| `echo '$name'` | Display with single quotes (literal text) |
| `$((5 + 3))` | Do math |
| `x=$(command)` | Store command output |
