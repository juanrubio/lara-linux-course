# Functions

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Welcome to Chapter 3, script master! You've conquered loops and conditionals, and now it's time to unlock one of the most powerful tools in bash scripting: FUNCTIONS!

  Think of functions like your own custom commands. Just like you use 'ls' or 'cd', you can create 'greet_user' or 'backup_files'. Functions are your secret weapon for writing amazing scripts!
</StoryBox>

## What Are Functions?

Imagine you're a wizard with a spellbook. Instead of memorizing every tiny detail of a spell each time, you just need to remember its name! Functions work the same way - they're named blocks of code you can use over and over.

**A function is:**
- A reusable block of bash commands
- A named group of instructions
- A way to organize your scripts
- Your own custom command

<FunFact>
  Functions in bash don't have to be declared before you use them in the script, but it's a good practice to put them at the top. This makes your scripts easier to read!
</FunFact>

## Creating Your First Function

There are two ways to create a function in bash. Both work exactly the same!

**Method 1: Using the 'function' keyword**
```bash
function say_hello {
    echo "Hello, World!"
}
```

**Method 2: Using parentheses (more common)**
```bash
say_hello() {
    echo "Hello, World!"
}
```

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Create a simple function
say_hello() {
    echo "Hello, World!"
}

# Call the function
say_hello
# Output: Hello, World!

# Call it again!
say_hello
# Output: Hello, World!

# Functions can be called multiple times!
say_hello
# Output: Hello, World!`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Notice how we wrote the code once but used it three times? That's the magic of functions! Write once, use forever!

  Most bash programmers prefer the parentheses style (method 2) because it's shorter and clearer.
</StoryBox>

## Why Use Functions?

Let's see a real example. Imagine you need to print a fancy separator line in your script:

**WITHOUT functions** (repetitive and messy):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=================================="
echo "Starting backup..."
echo "=================================="
# Do backup stuff
echo "=================================="
echo "Backup complete!"
echo "=================================="
```

**WITH functions** (clean and reusable):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

print_separator() {
    echo "=================================="
}

print_separator
echo "Starting backup..."
print_separator
# Do backup stuff
print_separator
echo "Backup complete!"
print_separator
```

Even better - if you want to change the separator, you only change it in ONE place!

## Functions Can Do Complex Tasks

Functions aren't just for simple things. They can run multiple commands:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Create a function that does multiple things
create_backup_folder() {
    echo "Creating backup folder..."
    mkdir -p ~/backups
    echo "Setting permissions..."
    chmod 755 ~/backups
    echo "Backup folder ready!"
}

# Call the function
create_backup_folder
# Output:
# Creating backup folder...
# Setting permissions...
# Backup folder ready!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Functions Make Your Scripts Organized

Think of a script like a book. Without functions, it's one long paragraph. With functions, it has chapters and sections!

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function definitions at the top
show_menu() {
    echo "1. List files"
    echo "2. Show date"
    echo "3. Exit"
}

list_files() {
    echo "Files in current directory:"
    ls -l
}

show_date() {
    echo "Today is: $(date)"
}

# Main script logic
show_menu
echo "Script complete!"
```

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Professional programmers LOVE functions! They make code easier to:
  - Read (you can see what each function does by its name)
  - Debug (if something breaks, you know which function has the problem)
  - Reuse (write once, use many times)
  - Test (you can test each function separately)

  It's like building with LEGO blocks instead of one giant piece!
</StoryBox>

## Calling Functions

Calling a function is super simple - just use its name!

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Define the function
celebrate() {
    echo "🎉 Awesome!"
    echo "🎊 You did it!"
    echo "🏆 Champion!"
}

# Call it by name
celebrate
# Output:
# 🎉 Awesome!
# 🎊 You did it!
# 🏆 Champion!`}
</TerminalDemo>

**Important:** You must define the function BEFORE you call it!

```bash
# This WON'T work:
say_hi     # Error! Function doesn't exist yet!

say_hi() {
    echo "Hi!"
}

# This WILL work:
say_hi() {
    echo "Hi!"
}

say_hi     # Success! Function was defined first
```

## Practice: Create Your First Function

<Challenge
  id="ch3-first-function"
  title="Create a Greeting Function"
  description="Write a function that displays a welcome message"
  steps={[
    {
      command: "# Create a file called greet.sh",
      hint: "Use nano or your favorite editor"
    },
    {
      command: "#!/bin/bash",
      hint: "Always start with the shebang"
    },
    {
      command: "greet_user() {\n    echo \"Welcome to Bash Functions!\"\n    echo \"You're going to love these!\"\n}",
      hint: "Define the function with commands inside"
    },
    {
      command: "greet_user",
      hint: "Call the function to run it"
    },
    {
      command: "chmod +x greet.sh && ./greet.sh",
      hint: "Make it executable and run it"
    }
  ]}

## Real-World Function Examples

Here are some practical functions you might use:

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Check if a command exists
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Create a dated backup
create_backup() {
    DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
    mkdir -p backup_$DATE
    echo "Backup folder created: backup_$DATE"
}

# Show system information
show_system_info() {
    echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
    echo "User: $(whoami)"
    echo "Date: $(date)"
}

# Display a colorful header
show_header() {
    echo "╔════════════════════════════╗"
    echo "║    MY AWESOME SCRIPT       ║"
    echo "╚════════════════════════════╝"
}`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Functions vs Commands

Functions are like temporary commands that exist only while your script runs:

| Commands | Functions |
|----------|-----------|
| Built into bash (ls, cd, etc) | Created by you |
| Available everywhere | Only in your script |
| Can't be changed | You can modify them |
| Limited options | Unlimited possibilities |

<FunFact>
  You can actually override built-in commands with functions! If you create a function called 'ls', your function will run instead of the real 'ls' command. But be careful - this can be confusing!
</FunFact>

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What is a function in bash?",
    options: ["A type of variable", "A reusable block of commands with a name", "A loop structure", "A file type"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A function is a reusable block of commands that you can call by name, making your scripts more organized and efficient!"
  },
  {
    question: "Which is the correct way to define a function?",
    options: ["function_name[] { commands }", "function_name() { commands }", "function_name { commands } ()", "def function_name { commands }"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The syntax is function_name() { commands }. The parentheses come right after the name, followed by curly braces with your commands inside!"
  },
  {
    question: "When must a function be defined?",
    options: ["After you call it", "At the end of the script", "Before you call it", "It doesn't matter"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Functions must be defined BEFORE you call them. Bash reads your script from top to bottom, so it needs to know about the function before it can run it!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you call a function named 'show_menu'?",
    options: ["show_menu()", "call show_menu", "show_menu", "run show_menu"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Just use the function name without parentheses or any special keyword. Simply: show_menu"
  }
]} />

## Challenge: Build a System Info Script

Put your knowledge to work! Create a script with multiple functions:

<Challenge
  id="ch3-system-info"
  title="System Information Dashboard"
  description="Create a script with functions that display system information"
  steps={[
    {
      command: "# Create sysinfo.sh with these functions",
      hint: "Create functions for different system info"
    },
    {
      command: "show_banner() {\n    echo \"====== SYSTEM INFO ======\"\n}",
      hint: "A function to show a banner"
    },
    {
      command: "show_user_info() {\n    echo \"User: $(whoami)\"\n    echo \"Home: $HOME\"\n}",
      hint: "A function to show user information"
    },
    {
      command: "show_date_time() {\n    echo \"Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)\"\n    echo \"Time: $(date +%H:%M:%S)\"\n}",
      hint: "A function to show current date and time"
    },
    {
      command: "# Call all functions in order",
      hint: "Call: show_banner, show_user_info, show_date_time"
    }
  ]}
