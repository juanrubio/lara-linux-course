# Running Scripts

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Ready for the final piece of the puzzle?

  You've learned to write scripts, but now let's make them run like REAL programs! No more typing `bash script.sh` every time!

  We're going to make your scripts executable - turning them into proper commands! Let's unlock this power!
</StoryBox>

## Remember the Permission Denied Error?

In lesson 2, when we tried to run a script with `./hello.sh`, we got this:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied`}
</TerminalDemo>

Why does this happen? Let's understand file permissions!

## Understanding File Permissions

In Linux, every file has **permissions** that control:
1. Who can READ the file
2. Who can WRITE (modify) the file
3. Who can EXECUTE (run) the file

Let's look at a file's permissions:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ ls -l hello.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 45 Dec 19 10:30 hello.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

Let's break down those weird letters:

```
-rw-r--r--
│││ │ │
│││ │ └─ Others can Read
│││ └─── Group can Read
││└───── Owner can Read & Write
│└────── No directory flag
└─────── Regular file
```

Notice something missing? There's no `x` (execute) permission! That's why we can't run it!

<FunFact>
  Linux permissions are like a security guard - they decide who can do what with each file. This keeps your system safe!
</FunFact>

## Making Scripts Executable

To make a script executable, we use the `chmod` command (change mode):

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ chmod +x hello.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

Now check the permissions again:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ ls -l hello.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 45 Dec 19 10:30 hello.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

See those `x` letters? Now everyone can execute the file!

## Running Executable Scripts

Now you can run your script with `./`:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ ./hello.sh
Hello, World!
This is my first shell script!
I'm learning Bash scripting!`}
</TerminalDemo>

It works! The `./` means "run the file in the current directory."

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Why do we need `./`?

  Because Linux doesn't automatically look in the current directory for programs. The `./` tells it "run the script that's RIGHT HERE!"

  Think of `./` as pointing and saying "this one, right here!"
</StoryBox>

## Three Ways to Run Scripts

Let's compare all three methods:

### Method 1: Using bash command
```bash
bash hello.sh
```
- ✅ Works without execute permission
- ✅ Simple and safe
- ❌ Have to type "bash" every time
- ❌ Not how "real" programs work

### Method 2: Making it executable with chmod
```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```
- ✅ Runs like a real program
- ✅ Shorter to type
- ✅ Professional way to do it
- ❌ Need to remember chmod first

### Method 3: Using sh command
```bash
sh hello.sh
```
- ✅ Works without execute permission
- ⚠️ Uses basic shell (might miss Bash features)

**Most professional scripters use Method 2!**

## Understanding chmod

The `chmod` command has several options:

```bash
# Add execute permission
chmod +x script.sh

# Remove execute permission
chmod -x script.sh

# Make it executable only for you
chmod u+x script.sh

# Make it executable for everyone
chmod a+x script.sh
```

Let's break down `chmod +x`:
- `chmod` - Change mode (permissions)
- `+` - Add permission
- `x` - Execute permission

<FunFact>
  chmod can also use numbers! `chmod 755 script.sh` does the same as `chmod +x`. The numbers represent different permission combinations!
</FunFact>

## The Shebang is Important!

Remember the `#!/bin/bash` line? It's SUPER important when running with `./`!

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ↑ This tells Linux: "Use Bash to run this script!"
```

Without it, Linux might use the wrong shell and your script might not work correctly!

## Practice: Make Your Scripts Executable

Let's create and run a script the professional way:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ nano greet.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

Type this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Script Master"
echo "Hello, $name!"
echo "Welcome to the world of executable scripts!"
```

Save and exit, then:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ chmod +x greet.sh
$ ./greet.sh
Hello, Script Master!
Welcome to the world of executable scripts!`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Creating a System Information Script

Let's build something useful:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# System Info Display Script
# Created by: [Your Name]

echo "=================================="
echo "   SYSTEM INFORMATION"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

echo "Current User:"
whoami
echo ""

echo "Current Directory:"
pwd
echo ""

echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h / | tail -1
echo ""

echo "Memory Info:"
free -h | grep Mem
echo ""

echo "=================================="
echo "Script completed successfully!"
echo "=================================="
```

Make it executable and run it:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ chmod +x sysinfo.sh
$ ./sysinfo.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="bash_betty">
  Now you're thinking like a systems administrator! They create scripts like this to quickly check system health!

  Imagine running this on 100 computers at once - you could monitor an entire network with one script!
</StoryBox>

    {
      command: './myprogram.sh',
      hint: "Run your program!"
    }
  ]}

## Where Do Programs Live?

You might wonder - why don't we need `./` for commands like `ls` or `cd`?

Because they're stored in special directories that Linux always checks. To see these directories:

<TerminalDemo>
{`$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`}
</TerminalDemo>

These directories are in your `PATH` - Linux automatically looks there for programs!

Want to run your script from anywhere? Move it to one of these directories (we'll learn this later)!

## Creating a Useful Daily Reminder Script

Let's create something practical:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Daily Reminder Script
# Run this every morning!

clear  # Clear the screen

echo "╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗"
echo "║      GOOD MORNING, CODER!             ║"
echo "╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝"
echo ""

# Show the date
echo "📅 Today is: $(date +%A,\ %B\ %d,\ %Y)"
echo ""

# Show a motivational message
echo "💪 Daily Goal:"
echo "   - Learn something new"
echo "   - Build something cool"
echo "   - Practice coding skills"
echo ""

# Show system status
echo "💻 System Status:"
echo "   User: $(whoami)"
echo "   Computer: $(hostname)"
echo ""

echo "╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗"
echo "║    Have an AWESOME coding day!        ║"
echo "╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x morning.sh
./morning.sh
```

<FunFact>
  Professional developers often create "startup scripts" that run automatically when they open their terminal. These scripts set up their coding environment!
</FunFact>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Command not found
```bash
$ hello.sh
bash: hello.sh: command not found
```
**Solution:** Use `./hello.sh` instead!

### Issue 2: Permission denied
```bash
$ ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied
```
**Solution:** Run `chmod +x hello.sh` first!

### Issue 3: Bad interpreter
```bash
$ ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
```
**Solution:** Check your shebang line - it should be `#!/bin/bash`

    question: "What command makes a script executable?",
    options: ["chmod +x script.sh", "execute script.sh", "run script.sh", "make script.sh"],
    correct: 0,

  },
  {
    question: "What does the ./ mean?",
    options: ["Previous directory", "Home directory", "Current directory", "Root directory"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "./ means 'in the current directory'"
  },
  {

    options: ["It makes the file bigger", "It tells Linux which interpreter to use", "It adds colors", "It's not important"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The shebang (#!/bin/bash) tells Linux to use Bash to run the script!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does chmod stand for?",
    options: ["Change mode", "Check mode", "Chmod mode", "Choose mode"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "chmod means 'change mode' - it changes file permissions!"
  }
]} />

## Best Practices for Executable Scripts

Follow these professional tips:

1. **Always start with a shebang**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

2. **Add comments at the top**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Script: backup.sh
   # Purpose: Backup important files
   # Author: Your Name
   # Date: 2024-01-15
   ```

3. **Make scripts executable right after creating them**
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```

4. **Use descriptive names**
   - ✅ `backup_photos.sh`
   - ✅ `system_check.sh`
   - ❌ `script1.sh`
   - ❌ `test.sh`

5. **Test before using on important data!**
