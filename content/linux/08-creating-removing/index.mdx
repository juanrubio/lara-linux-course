# Creating & Removing

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Building time! Now that you can navigate, let's learn to CREATE and ORGANIZE your own stuff!

  Think of this as digital LEGO - you'll build directories and files, and if you don't like them, take them apart!
</StoryBox>

## Creating Directories: mkdir

**mkdir** means "**M**ake **D**irectory". It creates a new folder!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  Downloads  Pictures

lara@raspberrypi:~$ mkdir projects
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  Downloads  Pictures  projects

lara@raspberrypi:~$ mkdir projects/python
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls projects
python`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Create Multiple Directories at Once

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ mkdir games homework music

lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  Downloads  games  homework  music  Pictures  projects`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Create Nested Directories with -p

What if you want to create `/projects/python/game1` but `projects` doesn't exist yet? Use `-p`:

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ mkdir -p projects/python/game1
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls projects/python
game1`}
</TerminalDemo>

The `-p` (parent) option creates all the folders in the path!

<FunFact>
  Without -p, mkdir would fail if any parent folder doesn't exist. With -p, it creates the whole path! It's like building a road AND the bridges along the way!
</FunFact>

## Creating Files: touch

**touch** creates an empty file (or updates a file's timestamp):

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ touch notes.txt
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  notes.txt  projects

lara@raspberrypi:~$ touch project1.py script.sh readme.md
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  notes.txt  project1.py  projects  readme.md  script.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Touch creates empty files - like blank sheets of paper ready to be written on! You'll learn how to add content later!
</StoryBox>

## Removing Files: rm

**rm** means "**R**e**M**ove". BE CAREFUL - there's no recycle bin!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  notes.txt  test.txt

lara@raspberrypi:~$ rm test.txt
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  notes.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Safety First: Use -i

Add `-i` to get a confirmation prompt:

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ rm -i notes.txt
rm: remove regular file 'notes.txt'? n
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents  notes.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

Type `y` for yes, `n` for no!

## Removing Directories: rmdir and rm -r

**rmdir** removes EMPTY directories only:

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ mkdir empty_folder
lara@raspberrypi:~$ rmdir empty_folder`}
</TerminalDemo>

**rm -r** removes directories with contents (CAREFUL!):

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ rm -r projects/old_game`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  **WARNING, RECRUIT!** The `rm -r` command is POWERFUL and DANGEROUS! There's NO UNDO! Always double-check before using it! Use `rm -ri` to get prompts for each file.
</StoryBox>

## The Danger Zone: rm -rf

You might see `rm -rf` online. This means:
- `-r` = recursive (go into folders)
- `-f` = force (no questions asked)

**NEVER run rm -rf without being ABSOLUTELY SURE!**

Especially avoid:
- `rm -rf /` (would delete EVERYTHING)
- `rm -rf ~` (would delete your entire home folder)

<FunFact>
  Stories of people accidentally deleting everything with rm -rf are legendary in the Linux world! One wrong command can ruin your day. Always double-check!
</FunFact>

## Practice: Build and Destroy

    { command: "ls test_folder", hint: "Verify the file exists" },

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What does 'mkdir -p a/b/c' do?",
    options: [
      "Creates only folder c",
      "Creates all folders: a, a/b, and a/b/c",
      "Fails if a doesn't exist",
      "Creates a backup"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The -p option creates the entire path, including all parent directories!"
  },
  {
    question: "Why should you be careful with rm?",
    options: [
      "It's slow",
      "There's no undo or recycle bin",
      "It asks too many questions",
      "It only works on weekends"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "rm deletes permanently! Always double-check before using it!"
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between rmdir and rm -r?",
    options: [
      "No difference",
      "rmdir only removes empty directories",
      "rm -r is slower",
      "rmdir is more dangerous"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "rmdir only works on empty directories, rm -r removes directories and all contents!"
  }
]} />
