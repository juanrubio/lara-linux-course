# Text Editors

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Time to level up! You can read files, search them, but now you need to CREATE and EDIT them!

  Text editors are like word processors for programmers. They let you write code, edit configuration files, take notes, and more!

  Today we're learning nano - the friendliest text editor in Linux!
</StoryBox>

## Why Use Text Editors?

In Linux, EVERYTHING is configured through text files:
- System settings
- Network configuration
- Program behavior
- Scripts and code

Learning a text editor is ESSENTIAL for any Linux user!

## Meet Nano

Nano is a simple, beginner-friendly text editor that runs in your terminal. Unlike Notepad on Windows, nano works entirely with keyboard shortcuts!

<FunFact>
  Nano was created as a free alternative to an editor called Pico. The name "nano" comes from nano-technology - something very small and precise!
</FunFact>

### Starting Nano

<TerminalDemo>
# Create a new file
nano myfile.txt

# Edit an existing file
nano existing.txt

# Create a file in a specific location
nano ~/Documents/notes.txt
</TerminalDemo>

When nano opens, you'll see:
- The file name at the top
- The editing area in the middle
- Keyboard shortcuts at the bottom

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  See those symbols at the bottom? The `^` means "Ctrl". So `^X` means "press Ctrl+X"!
</StoryBox>

## Nano Basics

Once nano is open, just start typing! It's that simple.

### Essential Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What It Does | Remember It As |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `Ctrl+X` | Exit nano | "X" for eXit |
| `Ctrl+O` | Save (write Out) | "O" for Output |
| `Ctrl+W` | Search (Where is) | "W" for Where |
| `Ctrl+K` | Cut line | "K" for Kut (cut) |
| `Ctrl+U` | Paste (UnCut) | "U" for Uncut |
| `Ctrl+G` | Get Help | "G" for Get help |

<FunFact>
  These shortcuts work even if Caps Lock is on! Nano only cares about the Ctrl key.
</FunFact>

## Creating Your First File

Let's create a file step by step:

<Challenge

  title="Your First Nano File"
  description="Create and save a file using nano"
  steps={[
    { command: "nano welcome.txt", hint: "Opens nano with a new file" },
    {
      command: "Type: Hello from Nano! This is my first file.",
      hint: "Just type normally"
    },
    { command: "Press Ctrl+O", hint: "This saves (writes Out)" },
    { command: "Press Enter", hint: "Confirms the filename" },
    { command: "Press Ctrl+X", hint: "Exits nano" },
    { command: "cat welcome.txt", hint: "Verify your file was created!" }
  ]}

/>

## Navigating in Nano

When editing longer files, you need to move around:

### Movement Keys

| Key | Movement |
|-----|----------|
| Arrow keys | Move cursor |
| `Ctrl+A` | Go to start of line |
| `Ctrl+E` | Go to end of line |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Page up |
| `Ctrl+V` | Page down |
| `Ctrl+_` | Go to specific line number |

## Editing Text

### Cutting and Pasting

<TerminalDemo>
1. Move cursor to line you want to cut
2. Press Ctrl+K to cut the line
3. Move cursor to where you want to paste
4. Press Ctrl+U to paste (uncut)
</TerminalDemo>

You can cut multiple lines by pressing `Ctrl+K` multiple times!

### Searching

<TerminalDemo>
1. Press Ctrl+W (Where is)
2. Type the text you're searching for
3. Press Enter
4. Press Ctrl+W again to find next occurrence
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Pro tip: If you want to replace text, press `Ctrl+\` (backslash) instead of `Ctrl+W`. Nano will ask what to find and what to replace it with!
</StoryBox>

## Saving and Exiting

### The Save Process

When you press `Ctrl+O` to save:
1. Nano shows the filename at the bottom
2. Press `Enter` to keep the name
3. Or type a new name and press `Enter`

### The Exit Process

When you press `Ctrl+X`:
- If you haven't changed anything, nano exits immediately
- If you made changes, nano asks: "Save modified buffer?"
  - Press `Y` to save
  - Press `N` to discard changes
  - Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and keep editing

<FunFact>
  Never used "Ctrl+C" before? It's the universal "cancel" command in Linux! Use it to stop most commands.
</FunFact>

## Common Nano Tasks

### Task 1: Edit a Configuration File

<TerminalDemo>
# Create a config file
nano ~/.config/myapp.conf

# Add settings
app_name=MyApp
debug=true
max_users=100

# Save with Ctrl+O, exit with Ctrl+X
</TerminalDemo>

### Task 2: Write a Simple Script

<TerminalDemo>
# Create a script
nano hello.sh

# Add this code:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
echo "Today is $(date)"

# Save and exit
</TerminalDemo>

### Task 3: Quick Notes

<TerminalDemo>
# Quick note-taking
nano ~/notes.txt

# Type your thoughts, save, done!
</TerminalDemo>

## Alternative Editors

Nano is beginner-friendly, but you'll hear about others:

| Editor | Difficulty | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **nano** | Easy | Beginners, quick edits |
| **vim** | Hard | Power users, speed |
| **emacs** | Hard | Programmers, customization |
| **micro** | Easy | Modern nano alternative |

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Start with nano. Once you're comfortable, you can explore vim or emacs. But nano will serve you well for years!
