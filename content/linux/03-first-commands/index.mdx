# Your First Commands

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Excellent, recruit! Now that you understand what the terminal is, it's time to speak your first words to the computer!

  Today you'll learn three essential commands that every Linux user must know. These are your bread and butter - commands you'll use every single day!
</StoryBox>

## Command 1: `pwd` - Where Am I?

When you first open a terminal, you're standing in a folder (directory). But which one? The `pwd` command tells you!

**pwd** stands for "**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory"

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ pwd
/home/lara`}
</TerminalDemo>

The output `/home/lara` tells you:
- You're in the `lara` folder
- Which is inside the `home` folder
- Which is at the root (`/`) of the system

<FunFact>
  Think of `pwd` like asking "Where am I?" in a huge building. The computer tells you exactly which room (folder) you're in!
</FunFact>

## Command 2: `ls` - What's Here?

Now that you know WHERE you are, let's see WHAT'S around you. The `ls` command **lists** the contents of a directory.

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Pictures  projects`}
</TerminalDemo>

Those are all folders (and sometimes files) in your current directory!

### Making ls More Powerful

`ls` has options that give you more information:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `ls` | Simple list |
| `ls -l` | Long format with details |
| `ls -a` | Show ALL files (including hidden) |
| `ls -la` | Both! Details AND hidden files |

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  5 lara lara 4096 Jan 15 10:30 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root    root    4096 Jan 10 08:00 ..
-rw-------  1 lara lara  220 Jan 10 08:00 .bash_history
drwxr-xr-x  2 lara lara 4096 Jan 12 14:20 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x  2 lara lara 4096 Jan 13 09:15 Documents`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Files that start with a dot (`.`) are hidden files! That's why you need `-a` to see them. It's like the computer's way of saying "these are boring system files, you don't need to see them."
</FunFact>

## Command 3: `whoami` - Who Am I?

Sometimes you need to know which user you're logged in as. The `whoami` command tells you!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ whoami
lara`}
</TerminalDemo>

Simple, but very useful when you're working on different computers or have multiple accounts!

  Three commands down, a whole universe to go! These commands are your navigation tools. Without them, you'd be lost in the digital wilderness!
