# Quest: The Lost Files

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  CODE RED, RECRUIT! We have a situation!

  The Chaos Dragon has struck again! Important mission files have been scattered throughout the system, directories are in disarray, and we need your skills to restore order!

  Your mission: Navigate the file system, create an organized structure, and recover the lost files. This won't be easy, but I believe in you!
</StoryBox>

## The Situation

The file system is a mess! You need to:
1. Create an organized project structure
2. Navigate between directories
3. Move and organize scattered files
4. Clean up the chaos

## Mission Part 1: Create the Structure

First, let's build a proper organization system!

<Challenge
  id="quest2-structure"
  title="Building the Base"
  description="Create an organized directory structure"
  steps={[
    { command: "mkdir mission", hint: "Create the mission folder" },
    { command: "mkdir -p mission/documents mission/backup mission/archive", hint: "Create organized subfolders" },
    { command: "ls mission", hint: "Verify your structure" }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

## Mission Part 2: Create the Files

Now, let's create some files to work with!

<Challenge
  id="quest2-files"
  title="File Creation"
  description="Create test files for organization"
  steps={[
    { command: "touch report.txt notes.txt secret.txt", hint: "Create three files" },
    { command: "touch mission/plan.txt", hint: "Create a file directly in mission folder" },
    { command: "ls", hint: "Check your work" }
  ]}
  xp={20}
/>

## Mission Part 3: Organize the Chaos

Time to put everything in its place!

<Challenge
  id="quest2-organize"
  title="File Organization"
  description="Move files to their proper locations"
  steps={[
    { command: "mv report.txt mission/documents/", hint: "Move report to documents" },
    { command: "mv notes.txt mission/documents/", hint: "Move notes to documents" },
    { command: "cp secret.txt mission/backup/", hint: "Make a backup of secret.txt" },
    { command: "mv secret.txt mission/archive/", hint: "Archive the original" }
  ]}
  xp={35}
/>

## Mission Part 4: Verify and Clean

Let's make sure everything is in order!

<Challenge
  id="quest2-verify"
  title="Verification"
  description="Verify your organization"
  steps={[
    { command: "ls mission/documents", hint: "Check the documents folder" },
    { command: "ls mission/backup", hint: "Check the backup" },
    { command: "ls mission/archive", hint: "Check the archive" }
  ]}
  xp={25}
/>

## Final Knowledge Check

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Great work organizing those files! Now let's test your knowledge with some questions!
</StoryBox>

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What's the difference between cp and mv?",
    options: [
      "They're the same",
      "cp copies (keeps original), mv moves (removes original)",
      "cp is for directories only",
      "mv is slower"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "cp creates a duplicate, mv relocates the original!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'mkdir -p a/b/c' do?",
    options: [
      "Creates only folder c",
      "Fails if a doesn't exist",
      "Creates all folders in the path",
      "Deletes existing folders"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "-p creates the entire path, including all parent directories!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you navigate up one directory?",
    options: ["cd up", "cd ..", "cd back", "cd -"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "cd .. moves you to the parent directory!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'rm -r' do differently than 'rm'?",
    options: [
      "Removes files faster",
      "Removes directories and their contents",
      "Asks for confirmation",
      "Creates a backup first"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "-r means recursive - it goes into directories and removes everything!"
  }
]} />
