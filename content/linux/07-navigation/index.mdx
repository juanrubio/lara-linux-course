# Navigation

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Time to learn how to MOVE, soldier! Standing still gets you nowhere in the digital realm.

  The `cd` command is your teleporter. Master it, and you can zip anywhere in the file system instantly!
</StoryBox>

## The cd Command

**cd** stands for "**C**hange **D**irectory". It's how you move from one folder to another.

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ pwd
/home/learner

learner@codequest:~$ cd Documents
learner@codequest:~/Documents$ pwd
/home/learner/Documents`}
</TerminalDemo>

Notice how the prompt changed from `~` to `~/Documents`? That shows you moved!

## Navigation Shortcuts

| Command | Where it takes you |
|---------|-------------------|
| `cd ~` or just `cd` | Your home directory |
| `cd /` | The root directory |
| `cd ..` | One directory up (parent) |
| `cd -` | Back to previous directory |
| `cd ../..` | Two directories up |

<FunFact>
  Just typing `cd` with nothing after it always takes you home! It's like clicking "Home" on a website - quick escape!
</FunFact>

## Tab Completion: Your Best Friend

Here's a SECRET that will save you HOURS of typing: **Tab completion!**

Start typing a directory name, then press Tab:

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ cd Doc<TAB>
learner@codequest:~$ cd Documents/`}
</TerminalDemo>

The terminal auto-completes for you! If there are multiple matches, press Tab twice to see all options.

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  ALWAYS use Tab completion! It's not just faster - it prevents typos too. If Tab doesn't complete, that means the file or folder doesn't exist (or you spelled something wrong)!
</StoryBox>

## Navigation Practice

Let's practice moving around!

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ cd /
learner@codequest:/$ pwd
/

learner@codequest:/$ cd home
learner@codequest:/home$ ls
learner

learner@codequest:/home$ cd learner
learner@codequest:~$ pwd
/home/learner

learner@codequest:~$ cd -
/home
learner@codequest:/home$ cd
learner@codequest:~$ pwd
/home/learner`}
</TerminalDemo>

See how `cd -` took us BACK to `/home`? Super useful when bouncing between two directories!

## Combining Commands

You can chain directories together:

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ cd Documents/projects/game
learner@codequest:~/Documents/projects/game$ pwd
/home/learner/Documents/projects/game

learner@codequest:~/Documents/projects/game$ cd ../..
learner@codequest:~/Documents$ pwd
/home/learner/Documents`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Common Mistakes

| What you typed | The problem | Solution |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| `cd documents` | Wrong case! | Use `cd Documents` (Linux is case-sensitive) |
| `cd My Documents` | Space in name | Use `cd "My Documents"` or `cd My\ Documents` |
| `cd downloads` | Doesn't exist | Use `ls` first to see what's actually there |

<FunFact>
  Linux is CASE-SENSITIVE! "Documents", "documents", and "DOCUMENTS" are three DIFFERENT folders. Always check with `ls` if you're not sure!
</FunFact>

    question: "What does 'cd ..' do?",

    options: ["It's required", "Saves time and prevents typos", "It's the only way", "It looks cool"],

## Navigation Cheat Sheet

```
cd              → Go to home directory
cd ~            → Go to home directory
cd /            → Go to root directory
cd ..           → Go up one directory
cd ../..        → Go up two directories
cd -            → Go to previous directory
cd folder       → Go into folder
cd path/to/dir  → Go to specific path
```
