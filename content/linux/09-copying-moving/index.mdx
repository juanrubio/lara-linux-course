# Copying & Moving

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Time to learn the art of duplication and teleportation! These commands will let you organize your files like a pro!

  Think of `cp` as a photocopier and `mv` as a teleporter!
</StoryBox>

## Copying Files: cp

**cp** means "**C**o**P**y". It duplicates files!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
notes.txt

lara@raspberrypi:~$ cp notes.txt notes_backup.txt
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
notes.txt  notes_backup.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

Now you have TWO files with the same content!

### Copy to a Different Directory

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ cp notes.txt Documents/
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls Documents
notes.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Copy and Rename

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ cp notes.txt Documents/my_notes.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Copying Directories: cp -r

To copy a directory with all its contents, use `-r` (recursive):

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ cp -r projects projects_backup

lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
projects  projects_backup`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  The `-r` stands for "recursive" - it means "go into all subfolders and copy everything inside too!" Without -r, cp refuses to copy directories.
</FunFact>

## Moving Files: mv

**mv** means "**M**o**V**e". Unlike cp, it MOVES (not copies) - the original is gone!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
notes.txt  Documents

lara@raspberrypi:~$ mv notes.txt Documents/
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
Documents

lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls Documents
notes.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

The file MOVED - it's not in both places!

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Think of it like this:
  - **cp** = Photocopy (original stays, you get a copy)
  - **mv** = Teleport (original moves to new location)
</StoryBox>

## Renaming Files: mv (again!)

mv is also used to RENAME files! Just "move" to a new name in the same folder:

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
oldname.txt

lara@raspberrypi:~$ mv oldname.txt newname.txt
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls
newname.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Rename AND Move

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ mv report.txt Documents/final_report.txt`}
</TerminalDemo>

This moves the file to Documents AND renames it!

## Moving Directories

mv works on directories without needing -r:

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ mv projects Documents/
lara@raspberrypi:~$ ls Documents
projects`}
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  Why doesn't mv need -r? Because moving is actually just changing the file's address - the actual data stays in place on the disk! Copying requires actually duplicating all the data.
</FunFact>

## Preventing Accidents: -i Option

Both cp and mv can overwrite existing files without warning! Use `-i` to be safe:

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ cp -i file1.txt file2.txt
cp: overwrite 'file2.txt'? n`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Comparison Chart

| Task | Command | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Copy a file | `cp` | `cp a.txt b.txt` |
| Copy to directory | `cp` | `cp a.txt folder/` |
| Copy directory | `cp -r` | `cp -r dir1 dir2` |
| Move a file | `mv` | `mv a.txt folder/` |
| Move a directory | `mv` | `mv dir1 folder/` |
| Rename a file | `mv` | `mv old.txt new.txt` |
| Rename a directory | `mv` | `mv olddir newdir` |

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What's the difference between cp and mv?",
    options: [
      "No difference",
      "cp copies, mv moves (original is gone)",
      "mv is faster",
      "cp only works on directories"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "cp creates a duplicate, mv relocates the original!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you copy a directory with all its contents?",
    options: ["cp dir", "cp -r dir", "cp -d dir", "cp -all dir"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The -r (recursive) option tells cp to go into all subdirectories!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do you rename a file from 'a.txt' to 'b.txt'?",
    options: [
      "rename a.txt b.txt",
      "rn a.txt b.txt",
      "mv a.txt b.txt",
      "cp a.txt b.txt"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "mv is used for both moving AND renaming files!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does -i do with cp and mv?",
    options: [
      "Makes it faster",
      "Interactive mode - asks before overwriting",
      "Info mode",
      "Nothing"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "-i prompts you before overwriting existing files!"
  }
