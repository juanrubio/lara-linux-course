# File Permissions

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Security alert! In the Digital Kingdom, not everyone should access everything!

  Imagine if anyone could read your diary, delete your homework, or modify important system files. Chaos!

  That's why Linux has an amazing permission system. Today you'll learn to control who can read, write, and execute your files!
</StoryBox>

## Why Permissions Matter

Linux is designed for multiple users. Permissions control:
- Who can READ a file (see its contents)
- Who can WRITE to a file (modify it)
- Who can EXECUTE a file (run it as a program)

This keeps your system secure and organized!

## Understanding Permissions

Let's look at file permissions:

<TerminalDemo>
ls -l myfile.txt
</TerminalDemo>

Output:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi users 1234 Dec 19 10:30 myfile.txt
```

Let's decode this mystery!

<FunFact>
  That weird string of letters at the start (-rw-r--r--) is actually a secret code that tells you EXACTLY who can do what with the file!
</FunFact>

## The Permission Code

The first 10 characters show permissions:

```
-rw-r--r--
│└┬┘└┬┘└┬┘
│ │  │  └─ Others permissions
│ │  └──── Group permissions
│ └─────── Owner permissions
└────────── File type (- = file, d = directory)
```

### Breaking It Down

```
-rw-r--r--
 ├─┤       Owner: rw- (read, write, no execute)
    ├─┤    Group: r-- (read only)
       ├─┤ Others: r-- (read only)
```

## The Three Permission Types

| Letter | Permission | What It Means for Files | What It Means for Directories |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| `r` | Read | View file contents | List directory contents |
| `w` | Write | Modify file | Create/delete files inside |
| `x` | Execute | Run as program | Enter the directory |

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Think of it like a club:
  - **r** (read) = You can look around
  - **w** (write) = You can change things
  - **x** (execute) = You can enter/run things
</StoryBox>

## The Three Permission Groups

Every file has permissions for three groups:

1. **Owner (u)** - The person who created the file
2. **Group (g)** - A group of users
3. **Others (o)** - Everyone else

<TerminalDemo>
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi users 1234 Dec 19 10:30 myfile.txt
         │   ││
         │   │└──── Group name
         │   └───── Owner name
         └───────── Number of links
</TerminalDemo>

## The Chmod Command

`chmod` (change mode) lets you modify permissions!

### Using Letters (Symbolic Mode)

<TerminalDemo>
# Give owner execute permission
chmod u+x script.sh

# Remove write permission from group
chmod g-w file.txt

# Give everyone read permission
chmod a+r document.txt
</TerminalDemo>

**The Format:**
```
chmod [who][action][permission] filename

who:    u (user/owner), g (group), o (others), a (all)
action: + (add), - (remove), = (set exactly)
permission: r (read), w (write), x (execute)
```

### Examples

<TerminalDemo>
# Add execute for owner
chmod u+x myscript.sh

# Remove write for others
chmod o-w secrets.txt

# Give read and write to group
chmod g+rw shared.txt

# Remove all permissions from others
chmod o-rwx private.txt

# Set exact permissions: owner gets all, others get read only
chmod u=rwx,o=r file.txt
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  When you create a script, you MUST add execute permission before you can run it! Otherwise Linux treats it as just a text file.
</FunFact>

## Using Numbers (Octal Mode)

There's a faster way using numbers! Each permission has a value:

| Permission | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Read (r) | 4 |
| Write (w) | 2 |
| Execute (x) | 1 |
| None (-) | 0 |

**Add them up:**
- `rwx` = 4+2+1 = **7**
- `rw-` = 4+2+0 = **6**
- `r-x` = 4+0+1 = **5**
- `r--` = 4+0+0 = **4**
- `-wx` = 0+2+1 = **3**
- `-w-` = 0+2+0 = **2**
- `--x` = 0+0+1 = **1**
- `---` = 0+0+0 = **0**

### Three Digit Permissions

Use three digits for owner, group, others:

<TerminalDemo>
chmod 755 script.sh
# 7 (owner: rwx)
# 5 (group: r-x)
# 5 (others: r-x)

chmod 644 file.txt
# 6 (owner: rw-)
# 4 (group: r--)
# 4 (others: r--)

chmod 600 private.txt
# 6 (owner: rw-)
# 0 (group: ---)
# 0 (others: ---)
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Most scripts use 755 (everyone can read and execute, only owner can modify). Most files use 644 (everyone can read, only owner can modify).
</StoryBox>

## Common Permission Patterns

| Code | Permissions | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `777` | rwxrwxrwx | Almost NEVER (too permissive!) |
| `755` | rwxr-xr-x | Scripts and programs |
| `700` | rwx------ | Private executables |
| `644` | rw-r--r-- | Regular files |
| `600` | rw------- | Private files (passwords, keys) |
| `555` | r-xr-xr-x | Read-only programs |
| `444` | r--r--r-- | Read-only files |

    { command: "ls -l testfile.txt", hint: "Verify: rw-r--r--" }
  ]}

## Making Scripts Executable

When you create a script, you must make it executable:

<TerminalDemo>
# Create a simple script
echo '#!/bin/bash' > hello.sh
echo 'echo "Hello, World!"' >> hello.sh

# Try to run it (this will fail!)
./hello.sh
# Permission denied!

# Make it executable
chmod +x hello.sh

# Now it works!
./hello.sh
# Hello, World!
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  The `+x` shortcut adds execute permission for everyone! It's the same as `chmod a+x`.
</FunFact>

## Security Tips

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  ATTENTION! Follow these security rules:

  1. **Never use 777!** It lets anyone do anything. Very dangerous!
  2. **Protect private files** with 600 (only you can access)
  3. **Scripts should be 755** (everyone can run, only you can modify)
  4. **Regular files should be 644** (everyone can read, only you can write)
  5. **Never change system file permissions** unless you know what you're doing!
</StoryBox>
