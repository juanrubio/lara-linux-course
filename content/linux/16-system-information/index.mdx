# System Information

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Welcome to Chapter 4: System Explorer!

  Every great Linux warrior needs to know their system inside and out! In this chapter, you'll learn to inspect your digital fortress - checking its name, how long it's been running, and gathering intelligence about your hardware!

  Let's start by learning who and what we're dealing with!
</StoryBox>

## Command 1: uname - System Identity

**uname** stands for "**U**nix **NAME**" - it reveals information about your operating system!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ uname
Linux`}
</TerminalDemo>

That's nice, but not very informative. Let's get more details!

### uname -a: All Information

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ uname -a
Linux raspberrypi 6.5.0-15-generic #15-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux`}
</TerminalDemo>

This tells you EVERYTHING: the kernel name, hostname, kernel version, processor type, and more!

### Useful uname Options

| Command | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| `uname` | Operating system name |
| `uname -s` | Kernel name (Linux) |
| `uname -n` | Network node (hostname) |
| `uname -r` | Kernel release version |
| `uname -m` | Machine hardware (x86_64, arm, etc.) |
| `uname -a` | ALL information |

<FunFact>
  The kernel version number tells you how up-to-date your system is! Higher numbers mean newer versions. The format is usually MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like 6.5.0).
</FunFact>

## Command 2: hostname - What's My Name?

Every computer has a name on the network. The **hostname** command shows it!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ hostname
raspberrypi`}
</TerminalDemo>

This is your computer's name! Other computers on the network can use this name to find you.

### Check Your Full Domain Name

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ hostname -f
raspberrypi.local`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Think of your hostname like your computer's nickname! Just like you might be called "Alex" at home but "Alexander Smith" formally, your computer has a short name (hostname) and a full name (FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name).
</StoryBox>

## Command 3: uptime - How Long Has It Been Running?

The **uptime** command tells you how long your system has been running since the last reboot!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ uptime
 14:23:01 up 5 days,  3:45,  2 users,  load average: 0.52, 0.48, 0.41`}
</TerminalDemo>

This shows:
- Current time: 14:23:01
- Uptime: 5 days and 3 hours 45 minutes
- Users: 2 users logged in
- Load average: How busy the system is

<FunFact>
  Server administrators brag about uptime! Some servers run for years without rebooting. The world record is over 20 YEARS of continuous operation!
</FunFact>

## Command 4: date - What Time Is It?

The **date** command shows the current date and time!

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ date
Fri Dec 19 14:23:45 EST 2025`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Format the Date Your Way

You can customize the output format:

<TerminalDemo>
{`lara@raspberrypi:~$ date +%Y-%m-%d
2025-12-19

lara@raspberrypi:~$ date +"%A, %B %d, %Y"
Friday, December 19, 2025

lara@raspberrypi:~$ date +%s
1734631425`}
</TerminalDemo>

The last one shows "Unix timestamp" - seconds since January 1, 1970!

## System Information Summary

| Command | Purpose | Example Output |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `uname` | OS name | `Linux` |
| `uname -r` | Kernel version | `6.5.0-15-generic` |
| `uname -m` | Architecture | `x86_64` |
| `hostname` | Computer name | `raspberrypi` |
| `uptime` | Time running | `up 5 days` |
| `date` | Current date/time | `Fri Dec 19 14:23:45` |

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  These commands are like your system's ID card! Whenever you need to troubleshoot or get help online, people will ask "What's your kernel version?" or "What architecture are you running?" - now you know how to find out!
</StoryBox>

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What command shows your operating system name?",
    options: ["osname", "uname", "system", "linux"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "uname displays Unix/Linux system information!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does the 'uptime' command tell you?",
    options: [

  },
  {
    question: "Which uname option shows ALL information?",
    options: ["-all", "-info", "-a", "-everything"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "-a shows all available system information at once!"
  }

## Real-World Use Cases

**Why are these commands useful?**

1. **Tech Support**: When asking for help, you'll need to share your kernel version
2. **System Monitoring**: Check if your server has been running reliably
3. **Script Writing**: Programs need to know what system they're running on
4. **Troubleshooting**: Different systems behave differently - know yours!

## What's Next?

You've learned to identify your system! Next, we'll explore disk space and usage.
