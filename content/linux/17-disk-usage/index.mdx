# Disk Usage

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Uh oh! My hard drive is almost full! Where did all the space go?

  Don't worry, young explorer! Today you'll learn the detective skills to track down disk space criminals. We'll use df and du - the dynamic duo of disk investigation!

  Think of your hard drive like a backpack - you need to know how much space you have and what's taking up room!
</StoryBox>

## Command 1: df - Disk Free Space

**df** stands for "**D**isk **F**ree" - it shows how much space is available on your drives!

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ df
Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       51474912 25737456  23083544  53% /
tmpfs            4021776        0   4021776   0% /dev/shm`}
</TerminalDemo>

Hmm, those numbers are hard to read! Let's make it human-friendly.

### df -h: Human-Readable Format

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G   25G   22G  53% /
tmpfs           3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev/shm
/dev/sdb1       100G   45G   55G  45% /home`}
</TerminalDemo>

Much better! Now we can see:
- **Size**: Total space available
- **Used**: Space already taken
- **Avail**: Free space remaining
- **Use%**: Percentage used
- **Mounted on**: Where the disk is connected

<FunFact>
  The `-h` flag means "human-readable" - it converts big numbers like 25737456 KB into friendly units like 25G. Much easier on the eyes!
</FunFact>

### df -T: Show File System Type

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ df -Th
Filesystem     Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1      ext4       50G   25G   22G  53% /
tmpfs          tmpfs     3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev/shm`}
</TerminalDemo>

Now you can see what type of file system each disk uses (ext4, tmpfs, ntfs, etc.)!

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Pro tip: If your disk is over 90% full, it's time to do some cleaning! A full disk can slow down your computer or even cause crashes!
</StoryBox>

## Command 2: du - Disk Usage

**df** tells you about entire disks, but **du** (Disk Usage) tells you how much space directories and files are using!

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ du Documents/
4       Documents/notes
8       Documents/projects/game
12      Documents/projects
20      Documents/`}
</TerminalDemo>

Those numbers are in kilobytes (KB). Let's make it readable!

### du -h: Human-Readable Sizes

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ du -h Documents/
4.0K    Documents/notes
8.0K    Documents/projects/game
12K     Documents/projects
20K     Documents/`}
</TerminalDemo>

### du -sh: Summary Only

Sometimes you don't want to see every subfolder - just the total!

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ du -sh Documents/
20K     Documents/

learner@codequest:~$ du -sh Downloads/
2.3G    Downloads/`}
</TerminalDemo>

The `-s` means "summary" - just show the total size!

### Finding the Biggest Space Hogs

Want to find your largest directories? Combine du with sort!

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ du -h ~ | sort -hr | head -5
2.3G    /home/learner/Downloads
1.5G    /home/learner/Videos
500M    /home/learner/Documents
250M    /home/learner/Pictures
100M    /home/learner/.cache`}
</TerminalDemo>

This shows the 5 biggest directories in your home folder!

<FunFact>
  The Downloads folder is often the biggest space criminal! People forget to clean it out after downloading large files. Always check there first when you need space!
</FunFact>

## Common du Options

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `du` | Show size of all subdirectories |
| `du -h` | Human-readable sizes (KB, MB, GB) |
| `du -s` | Summary only (total size) |
| `du -sh` | Summary in human-readable format |
| `du -sh *` | Size of each item in current directory |
| `du -a` | Include files (not just directories) |

## Checking Specific Locations

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ du -sh /var/log
150M    /var/log

learner@codequest:~$ du -sh ~/.cache
100M    /home/learner/.cache

learner@codequest:~$ du -sh /tmp
25M     /tmp`}
</TerminalDemo>

These locations often accumulate junk over time!

## The Difference: df vs du

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Remember this:
  - **df** = Disk Free - shows space on ENTIRE drives/partitions
  - **du** = Disk Usage - shows space used by SPECIFIC files/folders

  Use df to check your overall disk health, use du to hunt down space hogs!
</StoryBox>

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check disk space | `df -h` |
| Check disk space with types | `df -Th` |
| Size of a folder | `du -sh folder/` |
| Size of all items here | `du -sh *` |
| Find biggest folders | `du -h ~ \| sort -hr \| head -10` |

## Warning Signs

Watch out for these disk space problems:

| Use% | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| 0-70% | Healthy | No action needed |
| 70-85% | Getting Full | Consider cleaning |
| 85-95% | Almost Full | Clean up soon! |
| 95-100% | Critical | Clean up NOW! |

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  A full disk is like a full backpack - you can't add anything new! Keep at least 10-15% free space for your system to run smoothly.
</StoryBox>

## Space Cleaning Tips

Common places to clean:
1. **~/Downloads** - Old downloads pile up!
2. **~/.cache** - Temporary app data
3. **/tmp** - Temporary system files
4. **Old log files** in /var/log (advanced)
5. **Package caches** (we'll learn this later!)
