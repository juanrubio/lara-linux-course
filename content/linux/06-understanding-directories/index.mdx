# Understanding Directories

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Welcome to Chapter 2, explorer! Now things get really interesting!

  Think of the Linux file system like a giant upside-down tree. At the top is the root (the trunk), and everything branches down from there. Let me show you around!
</StoryBox>

## The Root of Everything: /

In Linux, EVERYTHING starts from one place: the **root directory**, written as `/`.

Unlike Windows (which has C:, D:, etc.), Linux has just ONE tree, and everything - your files, programs, devices - lives somewhere in this tree!

```
/
├── home/        (Your personal stuff)
├── bin/         (Essential commands)
├── etc/         (System settings)
├── var/         (Changing data like logs)
├── tmp/         (Temporary files)
└── ...          (And more!)
```

<FunFact>
  Even your USB drive and external hard drives appear inside this tree! Linux creates a folder for them and "mounts" them there. Everything is a file or folder in Linux!
</FunFact>

## Important Directories to Know

| Directory | What's Inside | Think of it like... |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| `/` | The root of everything | The lobby of a building |
| `/home` | User home directories | Apartment floors |
| `/home/lara` | YOUR personal folder | Your apartment |
| `/bin` | Basic commands (ls, pwd) | Essential tools |
| `/etc` | Configuration files | The building's control room |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files | A whiteboard (erased on reboot) |
| `/var` | Changing data (logs) | File cabinets |

## Home Sweet Home: ~

Your **home directory** is YOUR space. It's where you keep your files, downloads, and projects.

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ pwd
/home/learner

learner@codequest:~$ cd /
learner@codequest:/$ pwd
/

learner@codequest:/$ cd ~
learner@codequest:~$ pwd
/home/learner`}
</TerminalDemo>

The `~` (tilde) is a shortcut that ALWAYS means "my home folder"!

## Absolute vs Relative Paths

There are two ways to describe locations:

### Absolute Paths (Start from /)

Like a full street address. Always starts with `/`.

```
/home/learner/Documents/homework.txt
```

This works from ANYWHERE because it's the complete path from the root.

### Relative Paths (From where you are)

Like saying "it's next door." Depends on your current location.

```
Documents/homework.txt
```

This only works if you're already in `/home/learner/`!

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Think of it like giving directions:

  - **Absolute:** "Go to 123 Main Street, Apartment 4B"
  - **Relative:** "Go next door and turn left"

  Both can get you there, but one depends on where you start!
</StoryBox>

## Special Directory Shortcuts

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory | `cd /` |
| `~` | Your home directory | `cd ~` |
| `.` | Current directory | `./script.sh` |
| `..` | Parent directory (one up) | `cd ..` |

<FunFact>
  The `..` is super useful! If you're in `/home/learner/Documents/projects`, typing `cd ..` takes you to `/home/learner/Documents`. It's like climbing up a ladder!
</FunFact>

## Practice: Explore the System

<Challenge
  id="ch2-directories"
  title="Directory Explorer"
  description="Navigate and explore the file system"
  steps={[
    { command: "pwd", hint: "Where are you now?" },
    { command: "ls /", hint: "Look at the root directory" },
    { command: "ls /home", hint: "See what's in home" },
    { command: "ls ~", hint: "List YOUR home folder" }
  ]}

## Quick Quiz!

<Quiz questions={[
  {
    question: "What does the root directory / contain?",
    options: ["Only your files", "Everything in the system", "Only system files", "Nothing"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The root / is the top of the tree - EVERYTHING branches from it!"
  },
  {
    question: "Which path is absolute?",
    options: ["Documents/file.txt", "../photos", "/home/user/file.txt", "./script.sh"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Absolute paths always start with / and show the full path from root!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does ~ represent?",
    options: ["The root directory", "The tmp folder", "Your home directory", "The current directory"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The tilde ~ is a shortcut for your personal home directory!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does .. mean?",
    options: ["Current directory", "Root directory", "Home directory", "Parent directory (one level up)"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Two dots (..) mean go up one directory level to the parent folder!"
  }
]} />
