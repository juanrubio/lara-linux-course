# Processes

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Welcome to Process Management, recruit!

  Your computer is like a busy city - hundreds of programs are running at the same time! Each running program is called a PROCESS. Some are visible (like your web browser), others work invisibly in the background.

  Today you'll learn to see what's running, monitor resource usage, and even stop misbehaving processes!
</StoryBox>

## What is a Process?

Every time you run a program, Linux creates a **process** for it. Each process gets:
- A unique ID number (PID)
- Memory to work with
- CPU time to execute
- A parent process (the program that started it)

Think of processes like tasks on a to-do list that your computer is working on!

## Command 1: ps - Process Status

**ps** shows you a snapshot of currently running processes.

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 1234 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 5678 pts/0    00:00:00 ps`}
</TerminalDemo>

By default, ps only shows YOUR processes in the current terminal. Not very exciting!

### ps aux - Show ALL Processes

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.1  16808  9128 ?        Ss   Dec15   0:05 /sbin/init
learner   1234  0.0  0.2  21468  5012 pts/0    Ss   10:23   0:01 bash
learner   2345  2.3  5.8 892456 234816 ?       Sl   10:25   2:15 firefox
learner   3456  0.5  1.2  45678 12456 ?        S    11:00   0:30 python script.py`}
</TerminalDemo>

Now we're talking! Let's decode this:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **USER** | Who owns this process |
| **PID** | Process ID (unique number) |
| **%CPU** | Percentage of CPU being used |
| **%MEM** | Percentage of memory being used |
| **COMMAND** | What program is running |

<FunFact>
  PID 1 is always the init system (the first process that starts when your computer boots). Everything else starts from PID 1!
</FunFact>

### Useful ps Combinations

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Show all processes with details
learner@codequest:~$ ps aux

# Show processes in a tree (see parent-child relationships)
learner@codequest:~$ ps auxf

# Find specific process
learner@codequest:~$ ps aux | grep firefox
learner   2345  2.3  5.8 892456 234816 ?  Sl  10:25  2:15 firefox`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  The grep command is like a filter - it searches for specific text! "ps aux | grep firefox" means "show all processes, but only the lines containing 'firefox'!"
</StoryBox>

## Command 2: top - Real-Time Process Monitor

**top** is like a live dashboard showing your system's activity in real-time!

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ top

top - 14:23:45 up 5 days,  3:45,  2 users,  load average: 0.52, 0.48, 0.41
Tasks: 248 total,   1 running, 247 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  5.2 us,  1.8 sy,  0.0 ni, 92.5 id,  0.5 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
MiB Mem :   7856.3 total,   1234.5 free,   4321.2 used,   2300.6 buff/cache
MiB Swap:   2048.0 total,   2048.0 free,      0.0 used.   2987.4 avail Mem

  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
 2345 learner   20   0  892456 234816  89256 S   5.3   2.9   2:15.42 firefox
 3456 learner   20   0   45678  12456   8234 S   1.0   0.2   0:30.15 python
 1234 learner   20   0   21468   5012   3456 S   0.0   0.1   0:01.23 bash`}
</TerminalDemo>

Top updates every few seconds - it's alive! Press `q` to quit.

### Understanding the top Display

**Header Section:**
- **Load average**: How busy the system is (lower is better)
- **Tasks**: Number of processes
- **%Cpu(s)**: CPU usage breakdown
- **Mem/Swap**: Memory usage

**Process List:**
- Sorted by CPU usage (highest first)
- Shows real-time CPU and memory consumption
- Updates automatically!

### Useful top Commands

While top is running, you can press:
- `q` - Quit
- `h` - Help
- `k` - Kill a process (we'll learn this soon!)
- `M` - Sort by memory usage
- `P` - Sort by CPU usage
- `1` - Show all CPU cores separately

<FunFact>
  System administrators keep top running 24/7 to watch for performance problems! It's like having a security camera on your computer's activity!
</FunFact>

## Command 3: htop - Top's Cooler Cousin

**htop** is like top but with colors, graphs, and easier controls! (You might need to install it first)

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ htop`}
</TerminalDemo>

htop shows:
- Colorful CPU and memory bars
- Easy-to-read process tree
- Mouse support!
- Function key commands at the bottom

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  If htop isn't installed, you might see "command not found". Don't worry! We'll learn how to install software later in the course. For now, top works great!
</StoryBox>

## Process Control: kill Command

Sometimes a program freezes or goes crazy. You need to stop it! That's where **kill** comes in.

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Find the process first
learner@codequest:~$ ps aux | grep frozen_program
learner   9999  99.0  50.0 999999 500000 ?  R  14:30  10:00 frozen_program

# Kill it by PID
learner@codequest:~$ kill 9999

# Check if it's gone
learner@codequest:~$ ps aux | grep frozen_program
# (no output - it's gone!)`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Kill Signals

**kill** doesn't always "kill" - it sends signals to processes!

| Signal | Command | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| SIGTERM | `kill PID` | Politely ask to quit (default) |
| SIGKILL | `kill -9 PID` | Force quit (emergency!) |
| SIGHUP | `kill -1 PID` | Restart/reload |

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Try polite termination first
learner@codequest:~$ kill 9999

# If that doesn't work, force it
learner@codequest:~$ kill -9 9999`}
</TerminalDemo>

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  IMPORTANT: Always try `kill PID` first! It lets the program save its work and exit cleanly. Only use `kill -9` as a last resort - it's like pulling the power plug!
</StoryBox>

## Process Priority

Not all processes are equal! Some are more important than others. This is controlled by "niceness":

- **Nice value**: -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority)
- Default is 0
- Only root can make processes "less nice" (higher priority)

<TerminalDemo>
{`# Run a command with low priority (nice = 19)
learner@codequest:~$ nice -n 19 ./slow_script.sh`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Common Process Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Find a Frozen Browser

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ ps aux | grep firefox
learner   2345  99.0  25.0 892456 234816 ?  R  10:25  15:00 firefox

learner@codequest:~$ kill 2345`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Scenario 2: Find What's Using All the CPU

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ top
# Look at the top of the list - highest %CPU users!`}
</TerminalDemo>

### Scenario 3: Find What's Using All the Memory

<TerminalDemo>
{`learner@codequest:~$ top
# Press 'M' to sort by memory
# Or use: ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10`}
</TerminalDemo>

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List all processes | `ps aux` |
| Find specific process | `ps aux \| grep name` |
| Real-time monitoring | `top` |
| Better monitoring | `htop` |
| Stop a process | `kill PID` |
| Force stop | `kill -9 PID` |
| Sort by memory | In top, press `M` |

  }
]} />

## Process States

Processes can be in different states:

| State | Letter | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Running | R | Currently executing |
| Sleeping | S | Waiting for something |
| Stopped | T | Paused (stopped by user) |
| Zombie | Z | Finished but not cleaned up yet |

<FunFact>
  Zombie processes aren't dangerous! They're just waiting for their parent process to collect their exit status. They use almost no resources.
</FunFact>
