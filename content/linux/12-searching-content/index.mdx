# Searching Content

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Soldier! You can read files now, but what if you need to find ONE specific piece of information in THOUSANDS of files?

  That's where search commands become your best friends! Today you'll learn grep and find - two of the most powerful tools in your arsenal!

  Let's turn you into a search ninja!
</StoryBox>

## Why Search Matters

Imagine you're looking for:
- A specific error in a 10,000 line log file
- Which config file contains a certain setting
- All files that mention "password"
- Files created last week

Searching manually would take FOREVER! Let's use the right tools instead.

## The Grep Command

`grep` searches INSIDE files for specific text. Think of it as "Find in Page" but for the terminal!

<TerminalDemo>
grep "hello" myfile.txt
</TerminalDemo>

This shows every line in `myfile.txt` that contains the word "hello"!

<FunFact>
  "grep" stands for "Global Regular Expression Print" - but everyone just calls it grep! It's one of the most famous Unix commands ever created!
</FunFact>

### Basic Grep Examples

Let's create a test file and search it:

<TerminalDemo>
echo "The quick brown fox" > animals.txt
echo "The lazy dog" >> animals.txt
echo "The clever cat" >> animals.txt
echo "A brave fox" >> animals.txt

grep "fox" animals.txt
</TerminalDemo>

Output:
```
The quick brown fox
A brave fox
```

### Grep Options

Grep has super useful options:

| Option | What It Does | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-i` | Ignore case | `grep -i "FOX" file.txt` |
| `-n` | Show line numbers | `grep -n "fox" file.txt` |
| `-v` | Show lines that DON'T match | `grep -v "fox" file.txt` |
| `-r` | Search recursively in folders | `grep -r "error" /var/log/` |
| `-c` | Count matches | `grep -c "fox" file.txt` |

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  The `-i` option is super helpful! It makes "Fox", "fox", and "FOX" all match. Case-insensitive searching saves so much time!
</StoryBox>

### Grep in Action

<TerminalDemo>
# Find all lines with "error" (case insensitive)
grep -i "error" system.log

# Find "TODO" in all text files
grep "TODO" *.txt

# Count how many times "success" appears
grep -c "success" results.txt

# Show line numbers for matches
grep -n "function" script.sh
</TerminalDemo>

## The Find Command

While `grep` searches INSIDE files, `find` searches FOR files by name, size, date, and more!

<TerminalDemo>
find . -name "myfile.txt"
</TerminalDemo>

This searches the current directory (`.`) for a file named "myfile.txt".

### Find Examples

<TerminalDemo>
# Find all .txt files
find . -name "*.txt"

# Find all .jpg images
find . -name "*.jpg"

# Find files in a specific directory
find /home/pi/Documents -name "*.pdf"

# Find directories only
find . -type d -name "backup"

# Find files only
find . -type f -name "notes*"
</TerminalDemo>

<FunFact>
  The `*` symbol is called a "wildcard" - it means "anything"! So `*.txt` means "anything that ends with .txt"!
</FunFact>

### Advanced Find

Find can search by size, date, and permissions:

<TerminalDemo>
# Find large files (bigger than 10MB)
find . -size +10M

# Find files modified in last 7 days
find . -mtime -7

# Find empty files
find . -empty
</TerminalDemo>

## Combining Grep and Find

Here's where it gets POWERFUL! You can combine these commands:

<TerminalDemo>
# Find all .txt files and search them for "error"
find . -name "*.txt" -exec grep -l "error" {} \;
</TerminalDemo>

The `-l` option makes grep show only filenames (not the matching lines).

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  This combination is pure power! Find locates the files, grep searches inside them. Together they're unstoppable!
</StoryBox>

## Search Patterns

Grep can use special patterns (we'll keep it simple for now):

<TerminalDemo>
# Search for lines starting with "Error"
grep "^Error" logfile.txt

# Search for lines ending with "done"
grep "done$" tasks.txt

# Search for "cat" or "dog"
grep -E "cat|dog" animals.txt
</TerminalDemo>

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `^` | Start of line | `^Hello` finds lines starting with Hello |
| `$` | End of line | `bye$` finds lines ending with bye |
| `\|` | OR (use with -E) | `cat\|dog` finds cat OR dog |
| `.` | Any character | `c.t` matches cat, cot, cut |

## Real-World Examples

Here's how pros use these commands:

<TerminalDemo>
# Find your Python projects
find ~ -name "*.py"

# Find TODO comments in your code
grep -r "TODO" ~/projects/

# Find large files taking up space
find ~ -size +100M

# Search system logs for errors
grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog

# Find recently modified files
find . -mtime -1
</TerminalDemo>

## Quick Quiz!

      "Creates files"
    ],

      "Ignores case (makes search case-insensitive)",
      "Inverts the search",
      "Includes hidden files"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The -i option makes grep ignore case, so 'Error', 'error', and 'ERROR' all match!"

      "Searches for text inside .txt files",

      "Deletes .txt files",
      "Creates a .txt file"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "find with -name searches for files by name. The * wildcard means 'anything'!"

    question: "Which command shows only the count of matches?",
    options: ["grep -n", "grep -c", "grep -l", "grep -v"],
    correct: 1,
