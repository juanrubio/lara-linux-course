# Quest: The Secret Message

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  URGENT MISSION BRIEFING!

  The Digital Kingdom is under threat! The Shadow Hacker has hidden a secret message across multiple files in the system. This message contains critical information about their next attack!

  Your mission: Use your file reading, searching, editing, and permission skills to find the scattered pieces, decode the message, and save the kingdom!

  This is your most challenging quest yet. Are you ready, recruit?
</StoryBox>

## The Story

Long ago, the Kingdom's greatest defender created a secret vault containing information about future threats. The vault was split into multiple files, encrypted, and hidden.

Now the Shadow Hacker has found these files and added their own evil plans to them. You must:
1. Find the scattered files
2. Read their contents
3. Extract the secret codes
4. Assemble the final message
5. Secure the evidence

## Mission Setup

First, let's create the mystery files:

<Challenge
  id="quest3-setup"
  title="Initialize Mission Files"
  description="Create the mission structure"
  steps={[
    { command: "mkdir ~/secret_mission", hint: "Create mission directory" },
    { command: "cd ~/secret_mission", hint: "Enter the mission zone" },
    { command: "mkdir clues evidence decoded", hint: "Create subdirectories" }
  ]}
  xp={20}
/>

## Part 1: Discover the Clues

The first clue has been left for you. Create it:

<Challenge
  id="quest3-clues"
  title="Create the Clue Files"
  description="Set up the investigation"
  steps={[
    { command: "echo 'CLASSIFIED FILE ALPHA' > clues/file1.txt", hint: "Create first clue" },
    { command: "echo 'Code Fragment: THE-' >> clues/file1.txt", hint: "Add to file" },
    { command: "echo 'Next clue: Search for BETA' >> clues/file1.txt", hint: "Add hint" },
    { command: "echo 'CLASSIFIED FILE BETA' > clues/file2.txt", hint: "Create second clue" },
    { command: "echo 'Code Fragment: DIGITAL-' >> clues/file2.txt", hint: "Add fragment" },
    { command: "echo 'Next clue: Look for GAMMA in logs' >> clues/file2.txt", hint: "Add hint" },
    { command: "echo 'SYSTEM LOG FILE' > clues/logfile.txt", hint: "Create log" },
    { command: "echo 'ERROR: Connection failed' >> clues/logfile.txt", hint: "Add noise" },
    { command: "echo 'WARNING: Low memory' >> clues/logfile.txt", hint: "More noise" },
    { command: "echo 'CLASSIFIED FILE GAMMA' >> clues/logfile.txt", hint: "Hidden clue!" },
    { command: "echo 'Code Fragment: KINGDOM-' >> clues/logfile.txt", hint: "Add fragment" },
    { command: "echo 'INFO: System running normally' >> clues/logfile.txt", hint: "More noise" }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

## Part 2: Read and Search

Now use your skills to find the code fragments!

<Challenge
  id="quest3-reading"
  title="Extract the Codes"
  description="Read files and find code fragments"
  steps={[
    { command: "cat clues/file1.txt", hint: "Read the first clue" },
    { command: "cat clues/file2.txt", hint: "Read the second clue" },
    { command: "grep 'GAMMA' clues/logfile.txt", hint: "Search for GAMMA" },
    { command: "grep 'Code Fragment' clues/*.txt", hint: "Find all code fragments" },
    { command: "head -n 2 clues/file1.txt", hint: "Check file starts" },
    { command: "tail -n 3 clues/logfile.txt", hint: "Check log end" }
  ]}
  xp={35}
/>

<StoryBox character="pixel_the_penguin">
  Great work finding those fragments! Now you need to assemble them. Let me help you...

  The fragments you found were:
  - THE-
  - DIGITAL-
  - KINGDOM-

  But there's more! Create a file with the complete message!
</StoryBox>

## Part 3: Assemble the Message

Use nano to create the decoded message:

<Challenge
  id="quest3-decode"
  title="Decode the Secret"
  description="Assemble the complete message using nano"
  steps={[
    { command: "nano decoded/secret.txt", hint: "Open nano" },
    {
      command: "Type the assembled message: THE-DIGITAL-KINGDOM-IS-SAFE",
      hint: "Combine all fragments"
    },
    { command: "Save with Ctrl+O, Enter", hint: "Write out the file" },
    { command: "Exit with Ctrl+X", hint: "Close nano" },
    { command: "cat decoded/secret.txt", hint: "Verify the message" }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

## Part 4: Create the Report

Now document your findings:

<Challenge
  id="quest3-report"
  title="Mission Report"
  description="Create a detailed report"
  steps={[
    { command: "nano evidence/mission_report.txt", hint: "Create report" },
    {
      command: "Write a report with: Mission Date, Files Investigated, Secret Message Found, Status: Complete",
      hint: "Be thorough!"
    },
    { command: "Save and exit nano", hint: "Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X" },
    { command: "cat evidence/mission_report.txt", hint: "Review your report" }
  ]}
  xp={25}
/>

## Part 5: Secure the Evidence

Finally, secure your files with proper permissions:

<Challenge
  id="quest3-secure"
  title="Secure the Files"
  description="Lock down sensitive information"
  steps={[
    { command: "ls -l decoded/secret.txt", hint: "Check current permissions" },
    { command: "chmod 600 decoded/secret.txt", hint: "Make secret private (owner only)" },
    { command: "chmod 400 evidence/mission_report.txt", hint: "Make report read-only" },
    { command: "ls -l decoded/secret.txt", hint: "Verify secret is rw-------" },
    { command: "ls -l evidence/mission_report.txt", hint: "Verify report is r--------" }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

<StoryBox character="commander_byte">
  Outstanding work! Let me explain what you did:

  - **600 permissions (rw-------)** on secret.txt means only YOU can read and write it
  - **400 permissions (r--------)** on the report means only YOU can read it (no one can modify it)

  This is proper evidence handling!
</StoryBox>

## Part 6: Final Verification

Let's verify everything is in order:

<Challenge
  id="quest3-verify"
  title="Mission Verification"
  description="Confirm all objectives complete"
  steps={[
    { command: "pwd", hint: "Confirm you're in secret_mission" },
    { command: "ls -la", hint: "List all directories" },
    { command: "ls clues/", hint: "Verify clue files" },
    { command: "ls decoded/", hint: "Verify decoded message" },
    { command: "ls evidence/", hint: "Verify report" },
    { command: "find . -name '*.txt'", hint: "Find all text files" },
    { command: "grep -r 'KINGDOM' .", hint: "Search for KINGDOM in all files" }
  ]}
  xp={30}
/>

    options: ["644 (everyone can read)", "600 (only owner can access)", "They're the same", "Both are unsafe"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "600 is safer because only you can access the file. 644 lets everyone read it!"
  }
